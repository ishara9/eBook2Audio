      "Listening to the story, Vincent could only imagine the horror those on the Cursed ship had been through. ... At first, they were forced to go against their fellow humans, the strongest ability users that were known to exist. ... After feeling like they had pulled through, the Dalki had arrived. ... Although, judging from the story, the Dalki had allowed them a bit of rest, but only for a moment. ... Then when they had finally crashed as their only option. ... They thought that they could head to safety at the Shelter, that everything was over, only to enter a den full of Dalki. ... \"It was my fault. ... \" Sam continued to say. ... \"I was the one that led them to this Shelter, not thinking about it properly. ... Perhaps we could have tried to find a better place on the ship to huddle up. ... The strong Cursed members could have helped those fighting against the Dalki. ... Instead, we just jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire. ... \"Sam had continued on his story from where he had left off before. ... After rallying those in the Cursed faction, they headed for the Shelter with a few Dalki hot on their tails. ... Luckily there were still a few strong fighters left that were able to help and fight them off, Dennis and Fex being two of them. ... Eventually, after reaching the Shelter, it was only later that Sam realised his error. ... The Dalki in the Shelter had turned their attention towards the Cursed group that had arrived. ... They had grouped up, attacking them immediately. ... What was worse was the longer they spent fighting, the more Dalki would appear from the Shelter. ... Realising his mistake, Sam was panicking and now was overthinking what decisions to make. ... It was then that those in the Cursed faction had stepped up. ... The other leaders sacrificed themselves and had chosen to lead them off while fighting the Dalki. ... The good news was that the Shelter was a large one. ... There were many different buildings they could use for cover. ... It was a Shelter that had been built for around thirty or so thousand people in the first place. ... The Dalki and the Cursed faction weren't large in number, so it was like a large game of hide and seek for the two. ... The Shelter could act like a small town, hiding between houses and more. ... Which was exactly what Sam and the others with him were doing now. ... The split up had happened so fast, Sam had no clue where the others were. ... The only thing he could rely on was his nose, but he had two that were unable to move Nate and Layla with him. ... He wanted to go out and search for the others to see if they were okay using his nose, Knowing the worse ones would be bleeding.'With the two of them, it's hard for me to even move and help anyone. ... I don't really know what happened, but they haven't been able to recover.' Sam looked at Layla and Nate on the ground. ... The good thing was Sam had vampire strength, allowing him to lift the two of them. ... \"I told you to leave us. ... We will manage. ... \" Nate croaked, looking up. ... His eyes squinted as pain ran through his body. ... Even just moving his head was painful. ... \"Sam, do you really think it's your fault? ... \" Vincent asked. ... \"Do you know how many situations you have been put in and had to have made the right call? ... We can only look so far ahead, and we can't see into the future. ... Who knows if you stayed on the ship, what would happen? ... Maybe a Dalki would have spotted you and sent all those in the Shelter onto the ship. ... You could have been trapped with nowhere to run. ... \"You are a key player in the Cursed faction, and you always have been. ... Without you, Quinn would have made far more disastrous mistakes. ... \"'Did he just refer to himself in the third person?' Sam thought but chose to ignore it anyway. ... \"Bonny, Void. ... I assume the live stream is still going on. ... Are you using those drones to see what's going on at the moment? ... \" Vincent asked. ... The two were dazed as they didn't expect Quinn to start asking them questions like so all of a sudden. ... \"Ermm, yes. ... The drones were safe from the impact. ... We are using them to find any of those who are too afraid to fight, but we haven't been able to go out and help them. ... However, there is one drone that isn't in the Shelter at the moment. ... \" Void answered. ... \"One drone, what is it looking at the moment? ... \" Vincent asked. ... \"The fight between the five spiked Dalki and Hilston. ... Their fight has pushed beyond the Shelter, and they are still going at it even now. ... \" Bonny answered. ... For a fight to last this long, it meant only one thing, that the two titans that were fighting against each other were evenly matched. ... Still, when two strong foes fought against each other, it also meant that one wrong move and either one of them could end each other. ... \"For now, I think we should search for the strong ones in the Cursed faction. ... Sil, Borden, Fex, Dennis, Megan and Peter. ... We need to gather them all and regroup. ... A winner will eventually come out from the big two, and we have to use this opportunity to strike them while they are weak. ... Either way, today we will be getting rid of them both. ... \" Vincent said as he walked towards the door. ... \"I'm sick and tired of him having to worry about a human of all things. ... It's not right. ... \" Vincent mumbled. ... \"Don't worry about the Dalki in this Shelter. ... \" He continued. ... \"I'll get rid of them all. ... \" Before Vincent left, he stopped and looked at Bony for a few seconds. ... He started her straight in the eye as her face flushed red.'I guess while I'm in his body, I should try to help him deal with the problems that he can't face. ... I'm just helping him out.'\"I would give up on the boy. ... He already has two on his mind that are too much for him to deal with. ... Maybe when he is older, and he doesn't have other problems, you can give it a go. ... \" After saying these words, no one saw 'Quinn' again. ... \"Was it just me, or was Quinn acting kind of weird? ... \" Nate asked, hearing the whole thing. ... But it wasn't just him. ... Everyone in the room felt like that wasn't the Quinn they knew. ... The way he talked, the fluctuations in his voice, and most of all, there was a strong air of confidence around him.'Thatâ¦that wasn't Quinn.' Was Layla's thought as her body was slowly recovering from using up all of her Qi. ... 'Who was that then, and where is Quinn?' Inside the Shelter. ... The Blade kids had managed to stay together. ... When they arrived, they had been attacked by a few Dalki. ... They tried their best to use their abilities against it, but fighting against the Dalki and humans were different. ... Their fast movements and extremely resilient and strength made it nearly impossible for them to use their hand to hand combat skills they had practised with. ... However, they were fortunate due to Grim Graylash, an old man and the ex-leader of the Graylash faction, present with them. ... Regardless of this, the kids were still troubled because he was currently injured. ... They too were hiding. ... They had found themselves inside a storage room of some sort. ... Most of the containers were empty or destroyed as if the Dalki had already been through the room before. ... Grim was holding his side close out his ribs where blood continued to flow. ... In the crash, one of the Chained took advantage of the situation and attacked the ex-family leader, causing a serious wound to his body.'These kids are strong, but they will struggle against the Dalki out there. ... I need to find those that can protect them. ... I don't know how much longer I will last.' The old man thought it was at that moment. ... Three Dalki could be seen entering the large storage room. ... Or more correctly, they were heard. ... The old man, along with the Blade kids, were hiding behind one of the storage containers. ... They held their breaths as the heavy footsteps continued. ... \"You know if you wanted to hide, then you shouldn't leave behind a trail of blood! ... \" One of the Dalki shouted, noticing it outside of the place. ... He punched one of the strange continues in front of him, sending it flying to the side and crashing into the wall. ... Yet, no one could be seen underneath.'Blood, but I made sure to stop my wound with my ability?' It was then that Grim noticed he wasn't the only one that was hurt. ... One of the Blade kids had been injured as well. ... Blood was trickling down and could be seen under his trousers. ... It was Adeel. ... He had been hurt in the crash as well but hadn't told any of the others, so they wouldn't worry about him. ... He didn't want them to stay in one place because of his injury, but moving made the wound worse. ... It was then that the Dalki had spotted more trickles of blood leading towards another container. ... Seeing this, the Dalki smiled and called the other two. ... \"My my my, I thought trusting my nose would lead me to something interesting. ... \" A voice said in the back.'Huh, another human, but who could that be, and why would the person reveal themselves? ... Who could possibly take on three Dalki at once?' The old man wondered.******\n",

      "A loud bang went off in the Shelter, and soon after, a building started to collapse, crumbling into pieces falling to the ground. ... It sounded like a bulldozer had gone full swing, hitting a building, but the sound didn't stop there as the bang was heard again, as another building was hit. ... The cause of the noise was due to a mud-like humanoid beast being pushed back, crashing into the buildings. ... Right now, the beast had created a large shield, and a jet stream of water was pushing against it, not showing any signs of weakening. ... On initial impact, the strength had sent him through the buildings. ... Having reached the third building, he had found his footing. ... His back was up against the wall for support.'Damn it! ... This Shelter is horrible for the beast's body to fight in. ... She has all this open space to use her powers and get away without me getting close!' Raten was complaining. ... Worst of all, even his mud shield didn't seem to be working out against Vicky's water powers. ... The strength of a Demi-god tier beast was losing. ... Seeing that Raten was in trouble, Vorden soon made his move. ... He jumped between buildings, using his strong legs to propel himself like a spring, and heading straight for Vicky, who was standing in the middle of the street. ... Also, in the palm of his hand, a strong orb-like ball of wind was rotating, blue in colour. ... The beast had wind powers, and through practice and speaking with Tails, who was inside of his mind, he found out that the wind attacks could actually be contained and controlled. ... Condensing them several times and holding them all in a ball. ... Esseintly, it had the power of a tornado but with edges as sharp as a knife. ... \"I have no choice! ... \" Vorden shouted, throwing out the wind ball towards Vicky, but before it reached her. ... Pai quickly jumped in the way, and his body could be seen hardening on the spot turning grey like a metal colour. ... When the attack hit, the wind strikes enlarged and soon lifted Pai in the air. ... He was in a round Vortex, with the attacks constantly hitting him, but only faint scratches were made on his body. ... \"What are you two doing! ... \" Vorden cried out as he could see Raten's Shield turning into a slime mud substance. ... \"There is no reason for us to fight! ... Shouldn't we be getting rid of the Dalki, or you should be helping Hilston!? ... \" Vorden never wanted to fight his fellow siblings, who he had grown up with in the castle. ... He felt like there was even less reason for them to fight now. ... They had all caught a glimpse of the fight before they had arrived at the Shelter. ... Perhaps they didn't want to believe it, but they could see. ... It seemed like Hilston was losing. ... As if Vicky could read his mind, she shouted. ... \"As long as that man is alive, you know we have to do this! ... Hilston is a man that can never lose, never be beaten! ... \"Vorden wanted to say more, but being in the same position as herself, he could tell that Pai and her, the fact they were still acting out meant they were too far gone. ... Almost brainwashed in this belief.'The jet stream won't stop, and I can't put my shield down, but any longer, and it will melt. ... It doesn't look like Vorden can do anything against Pai either, not that I expected any help from that weakling in the first place.''Let me swap.' A voice said inside of Raten's head. ... At first, he thought he was going crazy. ... Soon he realized that there really was someone else that occupied the same mind as him. ... Unlike Vorden, Raten hardly communicated with him. ... 'Yeah right, you couldn't even beat me in a fight. ... What makes you think you could beat her?' Raten argued back.'You might be good at fighting hand to hand, but I am better at using my powers. ... If you die, we both die!' The beast angrily said as it forced Raten out of its body, and the control was now coming from the beast. ... The hard mud-like substance that would usually cover the rest of its body started to move and mix in with the mud Shield. ... Soon it created a large wall combining the two substances. ... The water continued to hit the wall making its consistency change by the second, but soon the whole wall had collapsed. ... Before she knew it, Vicky could see a strange thing heading towards her on the ground. ... She attempted to use her lightning powers, Zapping it on the floor. ... Still, the mud creature showed no signs of slowing down, even when being hit. ... When the mud creature was close, it formed a spike from itself, heading directly for Vicky. ... A clanging sound was heard. ... The one that had stopped the attack was Pai. ... At the same time, from behind, Pai was holding onto Vicky's hands. ... The two of them had finally achieved what they had been aiming for. ... \"Raten, we failed. ... We have to get out of here! ... \" Vorden shouted, not knowing that the beast was in control. ... Using his wind abilities, he was quick, but the strange power gathering inside the twins was a stream of water so powerful they would be dead in an instant being hit by that. ... It was their signature move when working together. ... Water powers were also what they had attempted to use to catch them on the island before.'With both of their abilities combined together. ... They will be able to destroy anything that touches that water, and it will be too large and quick for us to even run from, so what the hell do we do?' Vorden thought. ... Thinking about this and knowing there was no longer enough time to escape. ... He turned around, trying to plead his case once more. ... \"Do you really want to kill us? ... Why does Hilston even want Sil so badly in the first place? ... Have the two of you ever thought of that? ... He is so obsessed with getting Sil back he even left his precious island. ... Do you think any of us ever meant anything to him? ... Why are you doing this! ... \" The words didn't seem like they were getting through, and even Vorden was just repeating the same things over and over. ... \"Live your own life, like we have! ... \" Vorden shouted once more. ... Raten now back in control. ... Could see Vorden stupid mistake and quickly ran back. ... \"I'm sorry, muddy, but if anyone deserves to live, it's this damn softy! ... \" Raten said as he ran towards Vorden, ready to pull him down. ... Grabbing his shoulder, he pulled him back, risking his own life, that was until. ... Someone else grabbed both of their shoulders and threw them behind with a strong force that they landed on the ground. ... \"Borden? ... \" Vorden called out, noticing the familiar facial features but with the Dalki-like features. ... \"Yep,\" Borden said with a thumbs up. ... Seeing how confident Borden was, Vorden felt like he didn't understand the danger in front of him. ... The fact that once they joined hands, they were able to use the power of six ability users at once! ... \"No, even if you take that attack, you'll die! ... I know your body is strong, but you don't understand their power! ... \" Vorden shouted out desperately. ... \"Hey, relax before you get a bad throat. ... I'm not dying today, and I'm not the one dealing with it. ... There was another person I ran to on the way here. ... \" Borden replied. ... Before they knew it, another person was seen falling from above. ... Their blonde hair floated in the air, and a serious look was on their face. ... \"Sil? ... \" Vicky called out, noticing the main person they had been looking for this whole time, but Sil showed no regard for who they were. ... Instead, he ignored them and, when landing, placed both of his hands on the ground. ... In an instant, a giant pillar was created beneath them. ... It had appeared so fast it chucked the two up in the air. ... It looked like Sil had used a giant hammer when he had landed to knock the ground beneath them up, but it was just his strong earth abilities that he was using at the moment. ... Sil soon started to run, and beneath him, he created a staircase made of earth. ... Keeping up with his super speed. ... The whole thing looked impossible to anyone who even had these abilities. ... Just having such abilities and being able to use them like so were two different things. ... Reaching the two of them in the air, Sil grabbed both of their arms before they could do anything and, using his strength, pulled them, breaking their hands from each other. ... \"You guys always make the same mistake, taking the strongest elemental abilities. ... I learnt something when I lost to Hilston, but the abilities we choose are essential. ... I can't move as fast as him, my strength isn't as strong as his, so I'll just get an ability that can match him! ... \" Sil shouted, his hands started to glow blue, and the next second, lightning continually struck their body. ... The pain was so great it didn't take long for them both to pass out. ... The ground beneath Sil had now disappeared, and they were falling down out of the sky and quickly to the floor. ... When they landed, a large bang was heard as he hit the floor, and Sil's legs could be seen covered in a special coating, helping him receive no injuries whatsoever. ... Both Raten and Vorden stood there watching Sil, holding both Pai and Vicky in his hands. ... They weren't moving at all. ... For a second, he hadn't let them go and dragged them across the floor. ... When seeing that the others were okay, he finally let them go allowing them to drop to the floor. ... The two that they had so much trouble dealing with had been dealt with, so quickly and it was so overwhelming. ... \"He's gotten so much stronger, right? ... \" Borden said with a smile. ... \"I couldn't believe it as well until I saw him fighting against the Dalki. ... It's like he has had some kind of awakening. ... \"Although the other two didn't say it, both Vorden and Raten were thinking the same thing. ... Right now, the look on Sil's face as he walked towards them, the way he used his abilities and had no care for the safety of the others, reminded them of Hilston. ... \"I'm going to beat that old man. ... I won't let that Dalki get him first! ... \" Sil declared. ... ******Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "Sil, Borden, Raten and Vorden had all decided to move out from the original area where they had fought. ... Heading inside to one of the large buildings that seemed to act as a type of hotel. ... Although they didn't really use it to hide and instead were just waiting in the entranceway. ... The suggestion had been raised by Vorden because there was something serious the group needed to decide, and he wasn't quite sure that Sil was in the right mind to choose. ... On the floor, behind the desk, Borden was keeping an eye on them. ... Both Pai and Vicky passed out on the floor. ... \"We need to decide what to do with them? ... \" Vorden asked. ... \"What do you mean? ... \" Raten replied. ... \"If they wake up, you don't think they're going to try and fight us again. ... I think it's obvious what we need to do. ... \"Even without asking, Vorden knew what Raten's suggestion was going to be, so instead, he was looking towards Sil for support. ... Still, he seemed to have something else on his mind, and Borden, although he had some connection to all of them, didn't really to Pai and Vicky. ... \"Do you really think they would continue to fight us even if Hilston is taken out of the picture? ... I can tell that they are just following his orders, and it isn't something they want to do. ... \" Vorden argued. ... \"Even if that was the case, you said it yourself, if Hilston is taken out of the picture,\" Raten replied. ... The one thing Vorden wanted more than anything was time because Vorden had a feeling that after today, the Blade family would be different altogether, but soon Pai and Vicky would wake up again. ... They couldn't just keep fighting against them and knocking them out. ... \"I don't care what you do with them, Vorden. ... You can do what you want, but I need to go and get Hilston. ... Borden met up with mother, I met with father, which means the one that had met up with him was Peter, and I haven't been able to find him. ... \" Sil finally spoke, and it looked like he was ready to leave. ... \"Wait! ... \" A female voice shouted, but in an instant, Borden had his hand around her throat, gripping tightly. ... \"I have strength beyond what you could imagine. ... If you try anything, then I will squeeze, and it will be the end of your life. ... \" Borden warned, and he even applied a little bit of pressure to show he wasn't joking. ... The one who had called out was Vicky. ... She had regained consciousness a while ago and was listening in to the others to hear what they were planning to do. ... She wasn't stupid. ... The loss that she suffered before was because of Sil, and he could easily beat them again. ... Which was why she was waiting for him to leave. ... However, she had heard something, and she wanted to confirm it herself.'Why... ... is that a Dalki body? ... And this person, they look a bit like Sil? ... Who are they?' She thought. ... One thing was sure, unlike the others that might have had some sort of troubled feelings for her, this one did not. ... \"I... ... I. ... just wanted to ask what happened to mother and father? ... \" Vicky asked. ... \"They already left,\" Sil replied, continuing to look out of the entrance to see what was happening. ... \"I left the ship a little later compared to the others. ... I thought the two of them might try to help Hilston in some way, and I would try to stop them, but then I saw that the two of them decided to take off into the desert, running off to who knows where. ... \"Hearing this, Vicky's face was showing a hint of sadness and anger. ... Soon it started to change as she didn't really know what to feel. ... \"Vicky, you know they probably ran away to get away from all this mess, right? ... \" Vorden said. ... \"I mean, that island isn't normal. ... Look what happened to us. ... We are now in bodies that we don't even own, and all of this started because of him. ... \"Do you really think anyone would truly stay by Hilston's side if it wasn't for his power? ... I even saw some of the Chained doing the same thing. ... Rather than chasing after us or the Dalki, they ran into the desert. ... \"There was no reply from Vicky, so Vorden didn't really know what was going through her mind at the moment, but one thing was clear, she no longer had the will to fight. ... Even Borden seeing this, had let go of her neck, and she just stayed in place doing nothing.'Vicky has always been a hard one to get through to. ... Maybe the easy one to talk to would be Pai, whenever he wakes up.' Vorden thought. ... \"Sil, I don't think Peter is with Hilston at the moment,\" Vorden said. ... \"If Peter was ever in any type of serious danger, or his life was nearly lost, then Quinn would be there to save him. ... On top of that, rather than going after Hilston, we need to make sure everyone else is okay. ... Where is even that kid that follows you all the time, the one that helped us, Shiro. ... \" Vorden said. ... For the first time, Sil's eyes seemed to come to life as he turned his head, to look at the others. ... In his blinded thoughts of Hilston, he had forgotten entirely about Shiro. ... \"We have to- \"Interrupting his sentence was a loud bang that was in the centre of the Shelter. ... They all soon came rushing out of the hotel lobby to see what exactly was going on. ... Borden carried Pai over his back. ... The explosions didn't just stop once though, they continued to go on and on. ... It was clear signs of fighting were going on in the centre, and it wasn't just between a single Dalki and those from the Cursed faction. ... \"Maybe the others are in trouble. ... We have to go! ... \" Vorden shouted out, and they started running towards the sounds. ... Soon though, Vorden stopped to turn around as he could see Vicky standing there. ... \"Come on, you come as well,\" Vorden said, grabbing her by the hand and running along with everyone else. ... The landscape of the centre of the Shelter had wholly changed. ... The buildings were no more as nearly all of them had been reduced to rubble from the fighting. ... Those who were currently there and still fighting, it was a group of ten Dalki. ... Nine of them had two spikes, and one in the centre with the biggest grin on its face was a four spiked Dalki, named Patch. ... A nickname given to him due to the different coloured patches he had all over his body. ... Usually, a Dalki would mostly be black in colour, but he had lighter shades on his body, making him look somewhat like a cow. ... There were around three Dalki that had been killed on the floor around him, but Patch didn't seem to care, for he knew that the people responsible would soon meet their end. ... \"Guys, let's just get out of here. ... You two can't fight anymore! ... \" Megan shouted as she looked at a badly beaten Dennis. ... One of his arms was broken. ... The socket of his left eye had been smashed as well, so he was unable to keep it open. ... \"She's right! ... \" Shiro shouted. ... \"You used up the blood in your flasks, and our powers can't help you guys. ... We have to go! ... \"\"You don't understand. ... We can't leave this area! ... \" Fex shouted back. ... He, too, was badly injured, but more so internally. ... Having taken one punch from Patch.'That four spiked Dlaki, even after using the blood net, his punch still hit me and broke a few of my ribs.' Fex thought. ... As for the reason why they couldn't leave the area, Dennis and Fex could smell it. ... Those in the cursed faction were hiding in the houses, through the streets in the areas not too far from them. ... If they left, the Dalki would soon spot them and kill them all. ... \"This cow like Dalki! ... He's a four spike. ... He has to be the strongest in the area. ... If we just get rid of him, we can rest! ... \" Fex shouted, trying to give himself more energy. ... \"Hahah, me the strongest! ... \" Patch started to laugh along with the others behind him. ... \"If you truly believe that, then there was never hope for you all at the beginning. ... Right now, it looks like she has found someone she is enjoying her time with, and it's our job to make sure she isn't distracted. ... \"\"Are you talking about Dalki fighting against Hilston? ... \" A voice said from behind. ... \"Because we will get rid of them both. ... \"When turning around, Fex had never been happier to see the crazy boy and the rest of them. ... Sil had arrived with the others by his side, and they were ready to cause a splash. ... \"I'm sorry, but I would like to request that I deal with this one. ... \" Another voice said. ... It sounded familiar yet unfamiliar to a lot of them there. ... Breaking out of the Shadows, they could see his dark black hair and two gauntlets covering his arms. ... \"You will need to keep as many MC cells as you can for the big bad wolf. ... Otherwise, the pig's house will get blown down. ... \" Vincent said. ... \"Wait a second, do they still tell that story at this time? ... I guess no one understands my references anymore. ... \"Just we're going to need you, so I'll take care of this one. ... I just need you guys to make sure that the other little minions don't get in the way. ... \"\"I'm already on it! ... \" Another shouted from behind as his fist hit the Dalki straight in the stomach and sent it flying through the air. ... It was strength they hadn't seen before. ... Thinking about who it could possibly be, they could only imagine one person who was crazy enough to start fighting on their own before the others got involved. ... \"Screw you all! ... \" Peter screamed. ... \"I just need to get one punch in. ... Let me punch that old man just once! ... \" Peter shouted in anger.*****\n",

      "After punching the Dalki away, Peter didn't stop there. ... He quickly moved on to the next one y his side, showing off his incredible strength once more. ... However, rather than use his fists, he was using the pair of Tonfa weapons given to him. ... Logan's special design allowed them to shoot out from underneath his sleeves, holding them fairly in his hands. ... In the fight with Hilston, one of them had been bent, but they were still great tools for Peter to use. ... Another Dalki that was close by threw a punch, thinking that its strength would be able to match against Peter's, but when it collided with Peter's weapons, it was in for a surprise as the knuckles of the Dalki started to shatter. ... Being blunt weapons like so, it never thought it could receive damage so easily. ... \"All of you, get the hell off this planet! ... \" Peter continued to scream. ... There was something about Peter's actions and words in this fight. ... Usually, the only emotion he showed was aggression, yet they felt more pure and raw for some reason today. ... The reason being, was due to the planet they were on. ... \"You bastards nearly killed me, and now you're trying to hurt others again! ... \" Peter shouted, hitting another. ... This time, a Dalki had gotten behind him and clawed at his back. ... His healing abilities were doing him massive favours as it was getting better, allowing him to fight just as he usually would. ... Still, Peter would struggle to fight nine of them, but he didn't have to do it all alone. ... \"I understand Peter, I know why you're mad! ... \" Vorden said, coming in fast and spinning into one of the Dalki's body, head first. ... Then having two of the small compressed wind balls in his hands, he threw them down towards the Dalki on the ground. ... This planet, and the Dalki being here, was bringing back memories for them both. ... Because it was the planet where Peter had experienced near death, and it was from a Dalki. ... \"With them taking care of the others for me, I guess it's time I take out the boss,\" Vincent said, charging forward towards Patch, the four spiked Dalki. ... Watching from the back was Megan, Shiro, Fex and Dennis. ... Having already been injured, they were now in the middle of recovering. ... They weren't just injured but also exhausted since they had originally led the Dalki away when the Cursed members entered the Shelter. ... What Shiro and Megan were doing for the both of them now was producing small cuts on their hands, allowing the two to consume the blood, giving them time to heal. ... While doing so, they were paying close attention to 'Quinn' of all the fights that were going on. ... After all, they knew how strong Patch was.'That red glow on Quinn's hands, I've never seen like that before?' Fex started to wonder. ... Right now, Vincent was using the blood aura, not as an attack, nor was he using the hardened blood. ... Instead, with the amount of blood control Quinn was capable of and Vincent's knowledge, he had covered both of his hands in a type of red aura. ... When the Dalki came forward to attack, Vincent carefully hit them away, blocking them, and its hands were knocked to the side. ... The Dalki felt a slight pain as it touched the strange red aura. ... Vincent punched the dalki two times in the chest, causing blood to fall. ... It looked down at the blood oozing from its body, and the Dalki just smiled and punched Vincent back. ... He had hit him away and right back to where the others were.[50/100 Hp available]Skidding across the ground, he managed to use the tips of the gauntlets and dig in, slowing down until he came to a stop.'It did that much damage?' Vincent thought. ... He opened his mouth, and blood started to pour out. ... \"Blood bank activated! ... \" Vincent shouted through the blood-filled mouth, and his wounds were starting to heal. ... He still wasn't used to using the system quite yet through his mind, so he just called out commands instead that seemed to work as well.'I thought that would be enough, but a four spiked Dalki is completely different compared to a two spike and one spike Dalki. ... Now I understand why Quinn turned into the Bloodsucker straight away.' Vincent thought as they went in for round two. ... Charging in again, Vincent still had the red aura covering his hands. ... Despite the Dlaki's attacks coming in faster and stronger this time around, the red aura hands were still able to block the Dalki's attacks. ... Now, Vincent was more careful and was attacking the Dalki where possible. ... \"Why didn't Quinn use his shadow to block that last attack? ... \" Fex wondered. ... \"When was he this good at the vampire's hand to hand combat arts as well? ... \"Watching the fight, things weren't making sense. ... Vincent getting frustrated, started to use more blood moves. ... In the middle of his actions, he spun under a swing from the Dalki and used a blood bullet from below, aiming at its head. ... He was hoping it would go through its skull. ... The bullet left Vincent's fingers and went under the chin and through to the other side, but the Dalki was still moving. ... What was worse, the more Vincent was injuring it, the stronger it got, and Vincent wasn't sure he could keep up. ... By now, all the other Dalki that were supporting Patch, had been defeated by the others. ... With Sil and the Blades, they defeated them easily. ... \"Don't worry guys, I can handle this! ... \" Vincent shouted, still dodging the attacks. ... \"Don't help me. ... I just need to study it a bit more. ... \"It was a masterful display of skills but at the same time, worry for everyone else watching. ... They were wondering why Quinn wasn't fighting the way he usually was, but at the same time, it wasn't unknown to them for Quinn to try new things. ... \"Quinn, use your shadow scythe! ... \" Dennis shouted. ... \"Or your blood hammer! ... \" Peter said. ... \"That's one of my favourite attacks of his. ... \"\"He could also use his Muay Baron skills? ... \" Vorden said. ... Eventually, realising that nothing Vincent was doing was working, he had tried to go for the thigh kick he had seen Quinn do many times before. ... It looked great, but something was off as the power in his hips just went there.'Where's the snap in the legs? ... I'm sure I copied him perfectly.'When it hit Patch, nothing had happened.'Damn it, this is harder than I thought. ... I am not Quinn. ... I don't know how to use his Qi inside his body or use the shadow and fight at the same time, and these Dalki are difficult, to say the least. ... Doesn't he have any items I can use?' Vincent thought. ... Before he knew it, he was lifted by his leg up in the air. ... Thinking about items, the unbreakable sword appeared in his hands using shadow equip. ... Vincent swung it widely at the Dalki. ... Due to his strength and sharpness of the sword, it was able to produce cuts but nothing else. ... \"Alright! ... I think I might need some help,\" Vincent askedThat one word was enough, as Sil, Peter and all the others were seen charging in. ... From then on, with all of their powers, it didn't take long for Patch to be on his last breath. ... \"Hah.. ... look at you fools. ... \" Patch said, lying in his own blood. ... His body had been literally pulled and smashed apart, now he was on his last words. ... \"Slicerâ¦will kill you all. ... \"With the Dalki dead, a lot of them now had questions about the strange actions of Quinn. ... Even now, he was acting differently. ... As he was using a type of cloth to clean the blood off his armour and equipment, something they had just never seen Quinn do before. ... But before they could say anything. ... The people who were hiding, those who were shaking in terror, started to leave their buildings and from the streets and alleyways, all to cheer. ... \"They did it! ... Our leaders did it! ... \" They shouted. ... Soon more noise was coming from them, louder as more people joined in. ... \"Wait, why are they coming out now? ... What if there are more Dalki? ... \" Megan said worriedly. ... \"Don't worry about that,\" Vincent replied, walking back to them. ... \"I maybe couldn't take out the four spiked Dalki, but I was able to take out the rest in the Shelter. ... \"Everyone was glancing at each other, waiting for the other one to ask the question. ... \"Who the hell are you? ... \" Peter eventually asked. ... \"Did you hit your head, or are you like these guys? ... \" Peter asked, pointing towards Raten and Vorden. ... Seeing this, reminded Shiro of something. ... \"Oh I know, you're the other consciousness, the one that was inside Quinn that time, aren't you? ... \" Shiro asked. ... Now the others were even more confused, and it was the first time they had heard of this. ... Some knew of Quinn having a system, not all, but no one knew about Vincent being inside the system, and now he was going to have to explain himself. ... \"Well Iâ¦. ... Iâ¦\" Vincent was lost for words, but a strange feeling was coming over him. ... \"Arghhhh! ... \" He screamed, quickly falling to the ground. ... The power in his legs could no longer hold him up. ... \"My energy, what is happening to me! ... \" Vincent cried. ... \"Hey, is he okay? ... Is Quinn or whatever okay! ... \" Shiro worriedly said. ... \"Is he faking this to get out of the questions? ... \" Dennis wondered, but Fex and the others soon noticed the sweat running down his face. ... \"No, my energy is being taken out of me, and not at a low rate either. ... I don't think he was meant to take this much. ... \" Vincent replied. ... \"What are you talking about? ... We don't understand. ... \" Peter shouted. ... \"I'm talking about Quinn, of course! ... \"******\n",

      "One of the major issues with using the Demon tier amulet was that Quinn was unable to see through the eyes of those that were Marked, while also seeing through his own vision. ... He could switch who he had full control over and then see from that person's point of view, but not all of the Marked visions were shared. ... This meant Quinn didn't know what Vincent was currently doing, and neither did Vincent. ... Still, they both knew where the other was and what they were attempting to do. ... Which was why Vincent never expected such a vast amount of energy to leave his body. ... At first, it was gradual, but the fighting was over in the Shelter, so Vincent wasn't really worrying too much. ... He put on a brave face and ignored it, counting to act as he had been doing. ... However, soon the energy started to ramp up, so much so until his legs felt like jelly. ... If it wasn't for the fact that the Dalki had already been dealt with, and the others were nearby to help, Vincent would have left at the first sign of his energy being drained. ... It would have been too risky to continue fighting if Quinn needed the power.'Quinn, what is happening to you at the moment for you to have to use this much energy?' Vincent wondered. ... In a way, using the Demon tier amulet and borrowing energy from himself. ... Quinn could get a Dalki to the point where it was nearly as strong as his own body. ... The Dalki already had its own standard strength. ... If Quinn wanted, he could transfer close to ninety percent of his energy, which he was doing now. ... However, the Dalki wouldn't have Shadow powers, beast gear, or Qi. ... Only Quinn's skills and strength. ... With this thought, Vincent predicted that Quinn would only have to use this much energy if he was to go up against a four spike, as they had done.âââA little while ago, Quinn with the two Dalki by his side, had spotted a lone Dlaki by the foot of a volcano, standing just beneath the mothership. ... It was a strange sight to see because even after waiting a while and observing its actions, he could see they just stood there in the same place.'There are no Dalki ships as well. ... Did they clear them all? ... Or maybe they placed them closer up the Volcano closer to the mothership.' Quinn thought. ... Seeing how things were, the quickest way to get to the Dalki ship was to head straight for the Volcano. ... Walking around would take a considerable amount of time, especially without his shadow travel.'If the Dalki spots me and we get into a confrontation, I can use him to tell me where the other ships are.'With no pods or ships, the Dalki had no way to return back to the mothership. ... Unless the mothership itself landed. ... He was sure that there had to be more, other than the few he had fought. ... Nethereless, Quinn soldiered on thinking there had to be a way.'I can still do it. ... I don't need to overthink what is happening. ... The more time I waste, the higher chance I have of failing this quest. ... I just need to take down the Dalki mother ships.'It was then that the strange clothed Dalki had spotted the three of them, and that was when it had made its first move. ... Quinn could see what happened as if it played in slow motion. ... It was a single leg. ... That was all it took for the clothed Dalki to cover the distance between the two of them. ... It lifted one up as if he was going to go for a walk but suddenly jumped using the power of a single leg. ... It was in the air and soon directly in front of Quinn and the two others. ... \"You Dalki,\" Graham looked them up and down. ... \"I don't recognise the two of you? ... \"After these words, things started to move too fast for Quinn to be able to react to the situation. ... One of the Dalki by his right side had been grabbed by the neck. ... Its power, useless in front of whoever this was.'Two of us?' Quinn started to think as it was the first time he had heard these words. ... To humans, a lot of the Dalki features and Dalki looked similar to each other. ... It was only once in a while where they would come across one with something distinctive. ... The fact that Quinn's plan had worked so well meant one of two things. ... The Dalki didn't really pay attention to those that they were working with, or they too struggled to identify between each other. ... \"Did you two put him up to this? ... \" Graham asked, looking at the other two for answers. ... \"I thought it was strange our ships were going down rather quickly. ... I thought it might have been a specific individual, but there was also another option. ... I just never thought I would see it. ... The day that a Dalki could be convinced to move over to the other side. ... Of course, it could be an ability of some sort, but that's what I'm here to find out. ... \"A smile appeared on his face, and everything inside of Quinn was screaming danger. ... The Dalki's life in front of him was soon to die, so Quinn did what he thought would be best. ... To use the energy drain feature of the Dalki.'I didn't get to test out the energy drain, so I'm not really sure this will work, but I can only try.' Quinn thought. ... The Dalki that was being held soon started to feel weak. ... The strength in its limbs and eyes were disappearing from its body until eventually it had gone limp. ... Its life was gone. ... The good news was, as Quinn stood there, he could feel the surging energy of the Dalki inside of him. ... He knew that energy could be taken and given to the one with the amulet. ... Still, he wondered if power from the other Marked could be passed onto other Marked, and it seemed his little test was successful. ... He took note that the Dalki had died, just as the system had stated, there was no way to drain energy from one of the Marked without draining all of their energy. ... With this newfound strength, Quinn threw out a punch as hard as he could towards the strange Dalki.'Let's see how strong it is first, and then I can decide if I need to get energy from my own body or from the other Dalki.' Quinn thought. ... The fist that was thrown out was quickly grabbed by Graham. ... It was in the palm of his hand, and Graham hadn't even moved an inch from his spot. ... \"Oh, this is very interesting, that punch just now. ... Was it at the level of a top tier two spiked Dalki? ... Yet, you still only have a single spike on your back? ... Is this some type of mutation? ... I guess you are the important one in this little group. ... I have some questions for you. ... \"Quinn tried his best to move his hand, but it didn't seem to be working. ... The strength was too much. ... Even when fighting the three spiked Dalki on board the ship, using this much energy was enough.'I guess I'm just going to have to borrow a little from my own body.' Quinn did so while quickly switching his full control to the other Dalki. ... The energy was being transferred into the first one. ... Changing full control, Quinn was directly behind the clothed Dalki, and had jumped up, performing a spinning kick towards the head. ... The kick had landed, and even the impact was heard, but just like before, the body hadn't moved, and this was when Quinn could finally see it and could tell straight away why. ... Sticking out from the back of the clothing, he slowly counted each spike.'1â¦2..3..4..5 a five spiked Dalki, here of all places!'The Dalki that had just attacked and the one Quinn was in control of at the moment had its leg grabbed. ... \"Something is off. ... If you were really Dalki? ... Then surely you would have known that such weak attacks would have been useless against me. ... \" Graham said. ... The next second, the leg on the other Dalki had been pulled from its body. ... It felt like there was no resistance at all. ... Similar to a human pulling off a leg off an ant. ... It was then Quinn made the quick decision to drain the energy from the Dalki and give it to the one to itself as well.'What is going on, a five spiked Dalki? ... What do I do?' Quinn struggled to think. ... There were a few options, but he didn't have the appropriate time to think them through. ... The Shelter behind him still had humans and those from the Cursed faction. ... If the mother ship wasn't destroyed, then they were unable to leave through the teleporters. ... Quinn would be fine, but it would mean abandoning all the people and the Shelter. ... At the same time, if he used the energy from his body. ... Would it mean Vincent could no longer help the others? ... Due to him not being able to think clearly, the only thing he thought at that moment was that he needed to use all the strength he could muster to take down the Dalki in front of him. ... He had the power of three single spiked Dalki running through his body at the moment, and was drawing the energy from himself. ... He didn't know how strong he could get, but he just had to defeat what was in front of him. ... Now with all the strength in his body and having returned to the original Dalki who had its fist grabbed, Quinn performed a thigh kick. ... The strongest thigh kick that a Dlaki had ever produced in its life. ... Just moving his feet from the ground, the rubble was dragged up with it, the wind felt like it was shifting with the entire kick, and it had landed perfectly on the clothed Dalki's leg. ... To others, it would have sounded like thunder. ... The second it connected, the strength in the clothed Dalki's hands had loosened. ... Quinn used this opportunity to pull back, jumping away.'I can do it. ... I can fight with this body!' Quinn thought. ... Looking up again, Quinn this time, could see his head had been grabbed. ... \"You are interesting, very interesting. ... I'm going to be taking you back with me. ... \" Graham smiled, unhurt and unfazed by Quinn's power.*******Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "The Dalki known as Graham had a firm grip on Quinn's current Dalki body, holding him at the top of his head. ... Quinn, having delivered one of his most powerful moves while also being in a strong body that relied on sturdiness and strength it looked like his attack had hardly affected him.'With the last Dalki he was able to rip its limbs off with no trouble at all. ... He must have crazy grip strength. ... If I move my head, I'm done for!' Despite the thigh kick not working before. ... Quinn decided it was the only thing he could do. ... Now, lifting his leg up again, Quinn went to kick the leg not once or twice but did so until his body would give up or tire out. ... As soon as his foot touched the ground, he lifted it up again, kicking his opponent's thigh. ... Loud thunderous bangs after bangs echoed throughout. ... The strength of the kicks was shaking even the volcano nearby. ... \"That move seems rather interesting. ... Maybe I should give it a go? ... \" Graham said, still holding onto Quinn's head. ... He then lifted up and twisted his hips, trying to imitate the kick. ... It was a poor imitation of what Quinn had done, and it looked like nearly no effort had been put into it at all. ... Yet, the second the foot touched him, he could feel his whole body falling to the ground. ... Before he knew it, Quinn could see the dark sky above. ... Quickly, he tried to get back up, knowing the longer he spent on the floor would mean doom to himself.'Huh, why can't I get up?' Quinn wondered. ... It was only then that he realised that his left leg was bent in an unusual shape. ... His thigh almost looked like he had gained another joint. ... Underneath the hard Dalki skin, the area was heavily bruised and swollen.'Iâ¦. ... Iâ¦have to do something. ... If this guy gets to the Shelter, there will be no one who can stop him!' Quinn thought. ... Using this time, he realised that the Dalki was simply playing with him. ... All of his actions, not once had it seemed like it was being serious in the fight. ... Also, the Dalki wasn't aggressive like the others. ... Instead, it was slowly making its way towards Quinn. ... In a way, this just sunk in the fact that Quinn was outmatched in this situation. ... \"I have to get up, I have to, but I can't draw any more energy from myself. ... \" Looking at his hands, Quinn thought of the only thing he could do. ... With his sharp claws, he started to claw at his enormous chest. ... Digging in his fingernails around an inch deep. ... While in full control, Quinn could feel everything the Marked could, but he bore through it because he could tell it was working. ... The green blood flowing was making his body rise with new energy. ... After scratching at his chest multiple times, he soon continued to do so on his forearms, drawing more and more blood, and that's when Quinn started to notice something as well. ... The green blood leaving his body wasn't only giving him energy, but the swelling on his leg had gone down. ... He wasn't sure if he was imagining it, but his legs were also starting to heal themselves.'What is happening? ... I thought by hurting myself, I could muster up more energy, but losing blood is giving me the same effect as if I was to drink blood like a vampire?' Quinn started to think. ... It was a strange feeling, to say the least. ... Although his energy and strength were seemingly at an all-time high, he could feel his heart weakening as if he was about to die. ... Bordering on the line between life and death. ... And that was when the last change had occurred in Quinn's Dalki body. ... He could feel something growing from his back. ... Out from the middle of his back, a second spike popped out. ... \"An evolution at a time like this. ... Well, I can't say that I'm surprised, but if after all this time, you only were able to get to a two spike right now, it must have meant you haven't been doing a lot of fighting. ... Which is why I'm even more interested in you! ... \" Graham said, charging forward. ... Rolling like a log, Quinn moved away from a stomp coming from Graham. ... The hard ground broke apart, and red hot lava spewed from where he stepped. ... Soon Quinn pushed off the ground with his hands and looked ahead, trying to see where his enemy was.'Now I'm a two spiked Dalki. ... My powers have increased even more!' Quinn thought. ... 'It has to be a sign that someone wants me to kill this damn Dalki!'\"Don't get too excited. ... \" A voice from behind Quinn's ear said, and the next second, Quinn's head was slammed into the ground. ... It wasn't just bashed into once. ... Graham continued to hit his head into the ground again and again repeatedly, and whatever Quinn tried, it wouldn't work. ... Before Quinn could even move, he was injured.'This is the strength of a five spike?' Quinn was only left with these thoughts. ... 'Even with all this extra strength I have been given, I was still unable to do anything against it. ... I can't imagine anyone beating it. ... I haven't suffered a loss like this sinceâ¦. ... Arthur.'I wonderâ¦I wonder how I would have done if I was in my own body.'It was then that Quinn decided that he had no choice. ... He couldn't take the pain anymore. ... He had given up on trying to defeat the Dalki and found himself back inside his own body. ... \"Hey Quinn, are you okay? ... \" A young voice said. ... Looking up, Quinn could see the other members of the Cursed faction around him. ... He was in a pile of rubble, and the one who had spoken was Shiro.'It looks like everyone is safe here, Vincent. ... Do you think you could quickly update me on what happened here?' Quinn asked, looking for an update on the details. ... Giving him a quick skim of events, Quinn was happy to know that everyone was okay and that the Shelter was safe. ... His body was weak, and he wondered how long it would take him to recover, but that's when he realised something.'Wait, the Demon tier amulet, I can still feel the Dalki's energy. ... Has the Dalkinot killed him? ... He did seem different compared to the others, and if it was a five spike, he had to have been one of their leaders. ... Maybe I can get some more information from them?'Vincent, It looks like you did a good job, I'm sorry to say, but I'm going to have to leave you with them for a little while longer.'Of course, Vincent had no problem with such a thing, and Quinn soon found himself returning to Dalki's body. ... Arriving back in the Dalki, Quinn found himself in an immense amount of pain. ... He looked to be on one of the strange Dalki ships, heading towards the mother ship, and the one piloting it was none other than the one Quinn had fought not too long ago.'He smashed all of my bones, but it looks like he also knew the right amount just to keep me alive. ... I'm sure he has a lot of questions for me, and it looks like they knew just the right amount to keep this body alive as well.' Quinn thought. ... Keeping his mouth shut the whole way, Quinn's condition didn't seem to get better or worse. ... Finally, being carried by the Dalki with one hand, he found himself on the ship. ... Soon he had been taken to a room he had never seen before but was placed in something familiar. ... Now, the Quinn's Dalki body was floating in a green liquid in a giant glass tube. ... His bones still didn't seem to be healing, but Quinn could feel his mind waking up again. ... \"This chamber will keep you alive, and if I want to, I can make it so this liquid speeds up the recovery of your body, healing it. ... Interesting right? ... The other Dalki don't know about it yet, but I've been developing the solution myself. ... A way to make the Dalki heal even quicker and eventually evolve on their own. ... Repeating the process will allow us to force an evolution on those that didn't quite manage to evolve on their own. ... You are a fortunate person to be in here, although I won't be healing your body until I find out just why you are so special. ... \" Graham said as he went off not too far away and started to work away at a strange-looking computer. ... Quinn looked around the room to see if he could gather any information. ... Just being here now, he had already learnt that this strange contraption he was in was something they never knew about before. ... He wondered if it was because of such machines they had seen an increase in spikes on Dalki lately or if it hadn't been introduced yet. ... Both of them were worrying thoughts. ... Staring off far, Quinn could see that Graham kept on glancing at something. ... That's when Quinn noticed what it was. ... It was a live stream. ... The stream coming from Bonny and void. ... At the moment, what was being displayed was the fight between another five spike with a long tail, and Hilston.'Hilstonâ¦. ... will he win?' Quinn wondered as he started to think who was stronger, having fought him and a five spike recently.******\n",

      "Bonny and Void's live stream was considered popular around the world. ... However, In recent times their popularity only grew more. ... As fewer and fewer people were able or willing to broadcast during tough times. ... Focusing on current events and asking questions the people wanted to hear, going to places to find the information people wanted to hear. ... These were all elements that made them popular. ... The bulk of viewers would be the non-fighters and those not on the front lines. ... What they didn't expect was that right now, more people than ever were watching their broadcast. ... It wasn't just those civilians at home who were watching what was going on. ... The fight between Hilston Blade and the five spiked Dalki had more viewers than ever. ... They were people who had never heard of the Blade family before, yet now were able to witness their great power. ... On top of that, Bonny accurately gave the viewers everything they knew about the Blade family. ... The source of her information was none other than Logan. ... One of the people that hadn't left the Ship despite everything that was going on, was Logan. ... He could tell if anyone was to come his way. ... On top of that, he had the power to still control the Ship and control it in ways that would make it difficult for them to reach his position. ... As he expected anyway, not a single person had decided to stay on the Ship or come after him. ... During this time, Logan kept an eye on the stream, and he also found it amazing how many people were currently watching.'It's not just those on Earth? ... It looks like it's those on the Shelters as well that are watching what's happening. ... How are they able to deal with the Dalki attack going on?' Logan thought. ... Despite this, he had decided to inform the public about Hilston Blade and the Chained. ... Hilston was too big of a threat to leave untouched like they had done so far. ... If after this, he was able to roam around free again without people knowing how much of a dangerous person he was, it would be bad not just for the Cursed faction but the whole of humanity. ... All of the information he was giving was putting the Blade family in a bad light by Bonny, however despite all of this. ... People couldn't keep their eyes off him as they saw his sheer power being used against the five spikes. ... What Logan didn't know was that he was somewhat right about the Dalki currently not fighting against the others on the planet at the moment. ... This was because they were now watching the live stream and looking at the fight between the two. ... In the temporary base they had built on each of the planets, they were watching one of their great leaders fight it out. ... What the Dalki were building on each of the planets was what the humans had come to refer to as a Dalki fortress. ... These were small camps, where they would have strange walls made from the black material, in a similar shape to a wall made of logs. ... They would then have several towers on the outside larger than the wall. ... Although they were made very quickly, they were just as sturdy as the Shelters the humans made. ... This was mainly due to the black material that was used that seemed to be as hard as Glathriuem but nowhere near as hard to obtain. ... At least that's what the humans thought. ... In one of the fortresses, a dome-shaped arena had been built in the middle. ... The Dalki liked dark places, so they tended to make areas that would allow for little light to enter. ... They weren't affected by light in any way. ... Fighting wise or health wise, it just didn't feel natural to them. ... Perhaps it had something to do with the planet that they were born on or something to do with the nature of the beast they were made from, but no one truly knew why. ... Here was where One horn was currently at. ... He wasn't alone, as the other Dalki from the main mothership were inside as well. ... All of them were watching the projection that was being played on the wall. ... Large enough for them all to see. ... They were cheering at the screen every time Slicer would get a good hit in or a cut. ... What would be surprising to any human to see this, was they were doing the same every time Hilston would land a big blow as well. ... \"I'm surprised the humans had someone that could push Slicer this far. ... How do you think you would have fared? ... \" A Dalki asked who had one missing eye. ... Because of this, the others often referred to him as Clops, a three spiked Dalki that had recently obtained his fourth spike. ... \"Have you been listening to the video? ... From the sound of it, this is one of the strongest humans in the world. ... Someone that was left off the radar that even we don't know about. ... The strong point of Slicer is that tail of hers, but the armour he is wearing seems to be giving her trouble. ... If it was me, I would smash that armour with my fist. ... \" One Horn said, making a fist. ... Some of the others started to laugh, but as soon as One Horn looked their way, they quickly shut up. ... It wasn't usual for the Dalki to be scared of others. ... Even if they did have more spikes, it just wasn't in their nature, but One Horn had a more aggressive nature compared to the others. ... \"Leave them be. ... They know Slicer's strength because she has displayed it to everyone numerous times. ... Although she was someone who had evolved into a five spike before you, you are both a five spike now. ... \" Clops said, trying to calm him down and cheer him up. ... \"We don't know who would win a fight between the three of you. ... It's not like the past where you would all have a go at each other. ... \"The words certainly did put a smile on One Horn's face because it was true. ... One Horn had caught up to the two that used to be above him in strength. ... In the past, the Dalki would constantly fight each other over the leadership seat, and this was how One Horn had grown to the top. ... But even before that, he had been appointed representative of the Dalki to the humans by his fellow Dalki Graham, which was why he listened to him more so than the others. ... Graham could see that he had more strength than the others even before he knew it himself, but when One Horn had finally caught up with them, now having five spikes like the other two. ... Graham had told him that he was not to fight against the other leaders. ... For their powers now were too strong. ... A fight between two five spikes could possibly destroy anything they were on. ... âââThe Supreme commander had received the reports from all the Shelters that the Dalki had stopped their advance and attacks. ... Some of the Shelters wanted to use this opportunity to try to strike back, but Sach ordered against it. ... Going on the attack was not a good option straight after suffering such a large attack. ... They didn't have the forces, and they needed to use this time to recover. ... While doing so, everyone who was in the Shelter, including the fighters, were also watching the live stream. ... This was how nearly everyone in the world was tuned in to watching Hilston against the five spiked Dalki. ... Apart from one group in particular.'This. ... Fight, it seems to have great importance. ... We are seeing the strength of a five spike for the first time and seeing what one of our best against one of their best can do. ... While everyone is distracted, this is the perfect time for you. ... I hope you stay safe.' Sach thought. ... The very person that Sach was thinking of had finally arrived at the destination he had been called to. ... Although they hadn't arrived at the Shelter. ... Instead, a small army group of around three hundred or so, with Nathan in command, had landed in the middle of the jungle.'This is the place, the place where Oscar and Sach fought against One Horn.' Nathan thought as he looked off in the direction of the Shelter.******\n",

      "The Earthborn group had attempted to find out what was happening on this particular planet before. ... They had discovered a group of Dalki not too far away from a group of humans. ... This was something unprecedented, so they had come to the conclusion that the only reasonable explanation had to be that these 'humans' had to actually have been V. ... Alas, the first mission had turned out to be a disaster, mainly due to the presence of One Horn on that planet, who had bested Oscar, Sach and Samantha in a battle of strength. ... As if the subsequent loss of the Supreme Commander hadn't been enough, the military had also lost their only Demon tier weapon.'I was in charge of the reports back then and learned from Sach everything that happened.' Nathan thought as he and his group were still deep in the jungle-like territory away from the Shelter. ... The map displayed different routes and the area they were currently in. ... Because the military had once owned the Shelter they knew the area very well. ... It was perhaps what had also been Sach's downfall as he had been overconfident.'Sach warned me not to repeat the same mistake that they had made. ... One Horn should not be there, but I need to remain cautious and act under the worst case assumption that there might be a Dalki just as strong there..'Three men came out of the jungle in full beast gear. ... Underneath it was their military uniform. ... They gave a quick salute before handing in their report. ... \"Sir, we have finished scouting out the area as per your instructions. ... The Dalki are indeed still present. ... From what we could find out there has been little to no interaction between them and the humans in the Shelter so far. ... \"\"However, from what we could see it appears that the Dalki have spread out in a shape that allows them to act as sentries. ... Those on guard outside consist of eight single spiked Dalki, two, two spiked Dalki and finally a single three spiked Dalki who should be their leader. ... \"Taking this information in, the Dalki forces here were smaller than all those that had been sent to the other planets. ... They outnumbered the Dalki greatly which was good news all apart from one fact.'We should be able to handle one spiked and two spiked Dalki, especially if we can manage to divide and conquer them. ... But the three spikeâ¦ we might need to isolate him first or last to stand much of a chanceâ¦' Next it was Nathan's job to sort an attack force that could deal with the issue. ... Unfortunately, retreat wasn't really an option. ... The fact that the Dalki remained here and even went so far to protect this place, especially when they had launched an assault on other planets, meant that something on this planet was of great importance to them. ... Unfortunately, given the circumstances, Nathan couldn't call for reinforcement. ... This was a special task that had been given to him, the more people that knew about it, the higher the chance one of the V would find out, leak it and thereby cause all sorts of problems. ... On top of that, there weren't really any reinforcements to help in the first place.'The best course of action would be to have no confrontation in the first place, maybe I'm missing something.' Nathan thought as he continued to look over the files. ... The others were getting anxious and riled up, thinking that they were about to go into full combat any second now, but Nathan was sure that patience was the right answer in this situation.'The reportsâ¦what if we were wrong? ... I've spent a long time with Quinn and the others, so I know more about the V than anyone else here. ... Not only do their eyes turn red and they use the strange red aura for attacks, but their nose is so sensitive it can distinguish between humans and themselves. ... We aren't too far away from the Shelter, so shouldn't they have picked us up by now?''The reports also never specified any cases of V actually being spotted hereâ¦ Are these humans that are with the Dalki really working with the V? ... Rather than working with, could it be that the people are actually their prisoners? ... In that case, could it be that they're less worried about someone coming in and more about those people escaping?'Still, this theory raised the question of why Dalki, who had never been known to take prisoners, would go out of their way now? ... What's more the reports agreed that the inhabitants of the Shelter had fought back together with the Dalki.'That could just be due to us attacking them aggressively. ... At the time, the people must have been afraid due to the existence of the V, so they properly didn't take the time to check them out.'With this new idea in his head. ... Nathan ordered those three to watch if any of the humans ever left the Shelter, and if so to find out what they were doing. ... This way he could determine if they were collaborating or if they really were prisoners or not. ... A while later Nathan had received another report from his scout group. ... \"We have been observing them for a while now. ... The Dalki attack any of the beasts that enter the area. ... Once in a while a group of humans go out of the Shelter to gather resources and water from a river not too far. ... During this time, a single Dalki will head out with them. ... \"The group consisted of five people. ... It was a small number of people allowed to leave the Shelter. ... Clearly not enough for them to overpower the single Dalki. ... It was looking more and more like Nathan's new theory was right and that the people weren't the Dalki's allies but prisoners. ... \"Assemble two squads. ... I want the ten strongest men in terms of single attack strength abilities, and make sure that their abilities don't make much noise either. ... Their goal will be to kill the Dalki who accompany the people. ... After that make sure to capture the humans with them ALIVE! ... Get one of our intelligence agents on standby as well, some questions are going to have to be answered. ... \"Soon enough ten men gathered in front of Nathan, and with the information of the route and scouting team, they were able to all move together well due to the information. ... This was the way one would use the advantage of numbers, without necessarily needing all of them to be top fighters. ... When they had finally reached the river, they could see the group of people gathering large amounts of water. ... The Dalki stood next to them on watch. ... During this period, Nathan started to gather his ability in his hands, readying a bubble that was larger than any other. ... \"Okay, now! ... \" Nathan ordered. ... Immediately, coming out from the jungle forest, the group of ten all used their abilities against the single spiked Dalki. ... One squad aimed at his head while the other at his heart to ensure he would die in that one shot. ... Meanwhile, Nathan had run forward to encase all of the humans by the river in a giant bubble to ensure they wouldn't inform the other Dalki. ... The humans were shocked and hesitated about whether to help the Dalki or not. ... Two of them recognised the military uniforms, so they tried to use their abilities on the military personnel. ... However, while in the bubble they realised that something was wrong. ... \"What is this? ... Why isn't my ability working?! ... \" A man shouted in panic. ... Nathan's ability may not necessarily be the strongest, but it was perfect for dealing with other ability users, who weren't too much stronger than him. ... Looking to his left, he could see that his people had already accomplished their task, the Dalki had died before injuring any of them. ... When there was only one, a burst option of strong abilities was the best option, due to the Dalki's nature of getting stronger the more injured they were. ... Now that they were free, Nathan didn't have to worry so much about having to fight the humans. ... \"Now that the Dalki has been dealt with, I just have some questions I want to ask you. ... Please cooperate with us, so we can save everyone inside the Shelter. ... \" Nathan hoped that this approach wouldn't be met with resistance from them. ... Nathan made a sign for the other ten who still had their weapons drawn and abilities active to lower them, so that a fight could be avoided. ... Although they were inside his bubble, the people could still use their beast gear, and if they were to step out use their abilities again. ... Of course he didn't reveal that to the four of them.'Wait, why are there only four of them this time? ... Didn't the report say that the humans always traveled in groups of five?'\"Let them go, or I will be the one to take care of you all! ... \" A female voice shouted from behind. ... Turning around, a little down the river, Nathan could see a dark skinned woman with long braided hair, but what stood out about her the most was the weapon she had in her hand. ... It was glowing and pointing towards them. ... One felt cold just looking at the weapon.'That's theâ¦Demon tier weapon!' Nathan instantly recognised it. ... 'Why did the Dalki hand it over instead of keeping it for themselves? ... Were we unluckyâ¦ or was all of this a trap to lure us out?'******\n",

      "Quinn had decided to let his consciousness remain inside the Dalki body as this was a rare opportunity to learn more about the Dalki. ... Sure he had already been told about their origins, and he believed to know what their end goal was, but all of that had been told to him by others. ... By now, they had already become their own species and judging by the scientific method the Dalki was using on him, it was clear that he was someone with great intellect. ... Luckily for Quinn, apart from the fact that the five spiked Dalki had not outright killed him, was the fact that Graham was allowing him to watch the fight between Hilston and the five spiked Dalki. ... The Vampire Lord wasn't particularly cheering for one side or the other to win, in fact he would much rather see them defeat each other, but the important bit was that his Cursed faction had seemingly decided not to get involved. ... \"I see that you seem to be showing a great interest in the fight. ... \" Graham noted while still analyzing what looked like wave patterns on a certain screen. ... \"Honestly, I was half expecting you to tell me everything I needed to know about you by now. ... Begging me to restore your body back to the way it was, but you did no such thing. ... \"\"Are you not afraid of death? ... \" Graham turned around, looking Quinn right in the eyes. ... Quinn honestly didn't know what the right move was at the moment. ... Should he try and pretend that he was the Dalki that he had taken over, perhaps admit to having sold out his race? ... However, the question was whether he could actually pull it off? ... \"The look in your eyes, it's... ... different. ... You're the one of the few who has the same look as me. ... \" Graham muttered more to himself than to Quinn, before turning around and going back to his computer glancing at the fight happening in the background once in a while. ... \"Perhaps I have found someone who can understand me more. ... You see, the intelligence of our race is not inferior to that of humans. ... We are capable of doing the same things as them and just like them some of us are different. ... Unfortunately, most of us don't make use of that gift. ... The majority gives in to that aggressive impulse our bodies produce when we come across humans. ... I suppose in that way we are no different from beasts. ... \"\"I wonder if our creator designed us with that flaw in mind or if it was just a coincidence. ... Many may think that I'm the only specimen who has managed to surpass this urge, but the truth is they are completely wrong. ... It's just that my urge goes far beyond just simply wanting to kill off any one human I see. ... After taking my first life, I knew straight away that my urge went beyond that of my brethren, yet I had no way of satisfying it for the longest time. ... \"\"Speaking about humans, I still have to make up my mind whether I should consider us more or less advanced than even them. ... Speaking from a physical point of view, the answer might be obvious. ... However, while humans grow to reach their final form, what about us? ... We can evolve, but doesn't that mean that we have yet to reach our full potential? ... \"\"Each new spike opens up a new world, beyond our wildest imaginations, but does it ever stop? ... What might happen if we reach ten spikes, twenty or even a hundred? ... I consider it my duty to push my race to the top, so it will reach its peak, but of course there is one huge problem that might make it so I will never be able to personally witness the ultimate evolution of a Dalki... ... Our time limit. ... \"Listening carefully, Quinn was starting to realise that this Dalki was pretty insane. ... Talking about satisfying his urge beyond just killing a human... ... Did he intend to outright eliminate the human race then? ... Or was it the evolution of his race that he seeked? ... As for the last line, 'Our time limit' Quinn had a good guess what that was referring to. ... The short life span of the Dalki. ... He had long since wondered if this entire war couldn't be avoided. ... If the Dalki were forced to fight to find a way to escape death, couldn't they just hand over the Demon tier beast? ... However, after listening to the clothed Dalki speak, Quinn now understood that it might be impossible for both races to coexist, because it was just in the Dalki's nature to want to kill them. ... \"This is why I can't understand why you would be working with the other side. ... A weak one spike... ... well I suppose now you're a two spike going up against us? ... Just what could they have promised you to make you switch sides? ... Why would they even want to accept you, given that you would have run into someone who could have taken you out sooner or later? ... \" Graham asked, hoping for some reaction from his possessed brethren. ... \"Checking your brain waves I can tell that your mind isn't being controlled at the moment. ... You are able to register everything I'm saying even now, so why? ... How could they exploit us? ... \"\"Humans have weaknesses, people they care about, those they would risk their lives for to protect. ... Even the 'V' as they had so poorly been coined, who believe to be able to disregard their own feelings, have things they care about. ... Even that vampire had something that was used against him to get him over to help us. ... \"\"On the other hand, we were created at the same time. ... So we are all of a similar age. ... We are related but at the same time not, unable to have any children of our own that could be used against us. ... The only thing we care about is ourselves and were it not for our need to work together to save our own lives, we would probably fight each other to further evolve ourselves. ... \"There was silence in between. ... And Graham had turned around to look at Quinn once again, before turning away after getting no such answer. ... \"... ... a shame. ... I guess your sole purpose will be as just another one of my test subjects then. ... \" Graham sighed. ... \"Do you think she will lose? ... \" Quinn finally spoke from inside the Dalki's body. ... \"Slicer? ... As a five spike who hasn't seen the limits of her evolution how could it be possible for her to lose against that human? ... No, not only will she not lose this fight, there might even be a chance she could evolve from it. ... \" Graham smiled as the strapped Dalki could only be referring to the fight on the screen. ... That in itself was a scary thought, but Quinn could see a light. ... The one in front of him, the one fighting Hilston, and the one that had fought against Oscar. ... The Dalki weren't so much above them. ... These were the ones that they needed to beat. ... \"Are you willing to make a bet, if Slicer will be able to live?. ... \" Quinn askedGraham knew that the Dalki in front of him couldn't run anywhere else, so out of curiosity he shifted his gaze to the screen. ... He was eager to discover whether the confidence of his subject had any ground to stand on. ... Ruby continued to hold the Demon tier weapon in her hand. ... It was shaking slightly, something that Nathan didn't miss. ... \"You don't want to hurt us, do you? ... As you can see we haven't hurt any of your people, just the Dalki. ... I apologise for the way you might have been treated by my predecessors, but we're here to help you. ... \" Nathan put the palm of both of his hands up to calm her down. ... He knew the weapon was a ticking time bomb. ... If the active skills were used correctly all ten of them could perish in an instant. ... Ruby looked at the dead Dalki on the floor. ... It was then that water started to fill her eyes. ... \"Why? ... ... ... why did you come back? ... Just leave us alone... ... please. ... I-I don't want to... ... I don't want to cause any more trouble! ... \"It was apparent that Ruby was unstable, but Nathan couldn't just let them go before getting any information out of them. ... They were the key to finding out why the people in the Shelter were being kept as prisoners and why the Dalki would never give their prisoners something as vital as the Demon tier sword in the first place. ... \"Are you sure you want us to leave? ... \" Nathan questioned here. ... \"We've already killed that Dalki, so I'm sure you won't be able to just walk back like that. ... We also can't just let the others find out that we are here. ... You're humans just like us, surely you don't want to cooperate with the Dalki. ... Whatever they have on you, with that weapon and our help we can help you get out of here! ... \"Still not putting the sword down or letting go, it looked as if Ruby was considering his words. ... \"... ... no, he is already helping us! ... I can't let his troubles go to waste. ... \"The Demon tier sword started to glow brighter, and a strange ice vortex was forming around it. ... \"Everyone, get out of the way! ... \" Nathan shouted.*******\n",

      "NOTE: In the last chapter my Editor changed Graham from a five spike into a six spike Dalki, he is a five spike. ... A vortex of ice was swirling around the Demon tier sword. ... The motion started slow at first, but soon started to pick up speed as more ice formed around the blade. ... Nathan knew what was about to happen soon if they did nothing. ... His heart was beating, afraid of their demise if the sword's active skill would be fired off at them. ... One of the humans' great human treasures to be the end of him was not something he had expected.'That damn active skill creates a large tunnel of ice and just the smallest touch will make us turn into ice sculptures!' Nathan started to panic as his ability could do absolutely nothing against that. ... The General quickly made a signal with his hands, a sign for his subordinates to enter the bubble he had created. ... It didn't take long for a well trained group to overpower the group of normal civilians from the Shelter. ... In a matter of seconds they were disarmed, pinned to the ground, having faced next to no trouble at all. ... The soldiers then turned, while Nathan also moved himself, so they were to face Ruby and the charging Demon tier weapon.'I didn't want to do this, but I have to gamble that she won't hurt her own people.' Using those people as human meat shields left a bitter taste in Nathan's mouth, but it was clear that Ruby wouldn't just listen to reason. ... Nor could they run away or fight such a thing. ... 'I just hope she hasn't already gone through the motions of activating the skill yet.'Seeing what Nathan had done, Ruby of course didn't want to hurt those from her fellow Shelter. ... Unfortunately, great power was already flowing through the weapon and the woman felt like she was unable to move from her place. ... She attempted to lift the weapon away, but it was stuck in place as if her hands were frozen as well.'This is the first time I've tried using this weapon. ... I should have tried testing it a few times!' Ruby panicked. ... 'I have to do something.' Nathan thought as he ran forward. ... He wasn't sure if this would work, but he had to try something, otherwise they were all doomed. ... Two bubbles formed over his hands. ... \"Help me, I don't want to kill them. ... \" Ruby cried out. ... \"It's a deal then! ... I just need you to answer my questions and help me out after this. ... \" Nathan quickly agreed, as he held onto the demon tier's bladed edge of the sword with his finger tips. ... He pushed with such strength that the palm of his hands had been cut open from the blade but only ever so slightly, before the blade propelled with force and left her hands. ... It could be seen falling into the river nearby. ... At that moment, the active skill activated. ... For a moment it looked as if the whole river lit up, but seconds later the large body of water froze over. ... Some of the military personnel looked down the river to see how far it had frozen over, but it went even further than their eyesight could see. ... Rather than apprehending Ruby, who was now on the floor shaking, Nathan went to check if there was anything they could do about the Demon tier weapon.'If we bring this back to Supreme Commander Sach and the others, this will be a big help to us in the war.' Nathan concluded. ... When looking in the river it made for a strange sight. ... Despite its weight it was floating at the top. ... From the tip, the river was frozen, while the other half of the river continued to flow. ... One of the Earthborn group members was tempted to walk over the ice and go grab the weapon. ... \"Stop! ... Don't you know what will happen to you if you step on that ice?! ... \" Nathan shouted, and they were quickly reminded of the weapon's true terrifying properties. ... Nathan's bubble had a few more uses, but they weren't combat related, but today seemed to be his day. ... He coated himself in the bubble, and soon, jumped into the water. ... The current had weakened since half of the river was frozen, which was good but just in case, Nathan encased himself in a bubble so he wouldn't touch the wall of ice. ... Eventually he reached the sword and grabbed it by it's hilt. ... He could feel a terrifying energy residing within, making him wonder how Ruby had even been able to use it. ... Eventually he returned to the ground, his clothes should have been drenched in water but the bubble seemed to also protect him from that. ... He now had the biggest smile on his face. ... \"The Demon tier sword! ... It's actually back in the hands of the Earthborn group! ... No, that's not right. ... I'm part of the Cursed and we are part of the human race. ... It's back in our hands. ... With this we can help out with the war going on! ... \" Nathan exclaimed, before wrapping it up and placing it on his back. ... He had no sheath for the weapon so it stood out quite a bit.ââAfter what had happened, the Earthborn group and those from the Shelter including Ruby had headed back to their secret hiding space. ... The Dalki body had been hard to dismember, so the only thing they had been able to do had been to tie it up to some heavy rocks and chuck it into the river hoping that it would take a long time until the enemy found it. ... The group of soldiers and civilians were now in an open cleared area, where the nearby trees had been cut down, and there were a few tents. ... Not all of the three hundred men had stuck together, so this was just being used as a temporary space for Nathan and the others. ... \"You should hurry getting off this place. ... \" Ruby finally spoke. ... \"Even if they don't find the body, the fact that we haven't come back yet, means that they will soon come looking for us. ... They will think we've escaped. ... \"\"I know, I have a rough understanding of your situation. ... \" Nathan said, bringing over a nice warm drink in a cup, placing it in her hands, The rest of the military group were doing the same. ... Hoping not to treat them as enemies, getting them to feel more comfortable and to speak more freely. ... \"Which is why I need you to tell me just what is going on? ... I'll be open with you. ... Just as you have already guessed we're from the military. ... I know that the ones who have come before have treated you unjustly and for that you have my deepest apologies, but we are here to get you out of this situation. ... Isn't this your best chance while One Horn isn't here? ... \" Nathan asked. ... The General spoke loudly on purpose, so the others nearby could hear, their reaction looked like they were quite pleased about what was said. ... Perhaps they did want to be saved, but they were waiting, waiting for Ruby to decide. ... It was clear that she was the one in charge around here. ... There had to be a reason she was the one given the Demon tier weapon. ... \"Just tell them Ruby! ... \" One of the men demanded. ... \"I know Arthur helped us before, but this is the military we are talking about! ... They can help us. ... \"Ruby clenched her fist and looked right past Nathan towards the one who had just spoken. ... \"Exactly, they're the same military who abandoned us at the first sign there was trouble! ... Do you remember who saved us from those beasts? ... It was Arthur! ... The military were the ones who had chosen to attack us! ... \"Hearing the name 'Arthur' Nathan was trying to recall if he had heard of someone of significance with that name, but there was no one who came to mind. ... \"Look, I promised I would answer your questions because you helped me from harming my fellow men, even if I can't agree with your methods. ... \" Ruby admitted in an angry tone. ... \"The truth isâ¦ we don't really know what's going on at the moment, either. ... Arthur just came by and told us that we would be okay, that the Dalki would help us. ... \"\"It was hard to believe, but they kept their distance and they did protect us from beasts and the like. ... Eventually your military came andâ¦ well, you probably know the rest yourselves. ... \"\"You keep mentioning this Arthur. ... Is he someone we should know? ... \" Nathan couldn't help but ask. ... \"The person who saved our lives The one who came here when the military had left this Shelter back when it was a red portal planet. ... He was the one who showed us how to fight back, helped us grow our community and we were able to live happy lives without caring about those outside. ... Then, he just came back one day, only with the Dalki as company. ... \"\"The only information we got from Arthur himself was that they would help us, and that the human race would lose the war against the Dalki. ... It was the only way that we would survive, because not even he could beat them. ... \"It was clearly devastating news, to hear that this Arthur person that had saved them claimed he was unable to beat the Dalki, but there were plenty of people who would be afraid of fighting the Dalki, especially after what they were going through, so what was the big deal? ... Nathan struggled to comprehend.******\n",

      "The questions from Nathan didn't stop there, as there was still plenty more that he needed to find out. ... First of all, just what type of deal had this Arthur person struck with the Dalki to make it so that they would protect humans? ... It didn't really make any sense for those bloodthirsty creatures to suddenly change their nature. ... What reason could the Dalki possibly have to listen to his request, especially if Ruby and the others didn't lie about the part of him being stronger than them? ... Unfortunately, Ruby and the others seemed to know next to nothing about this Arthur, apart that he had chosen to act as their benefactor. ... After some more questioning, Nathan finally stumbled upon something they could tell them and that was in regards to the powers Arthur had displayed. ... Apart from Ruby the others had also confirmed that this Arthur person had used powers that sounded similar to the red aura used by the V, yet he seemed to have another power on top of that. ... The shadow power he was apparently capable of using sounded awfully close to what he had seen some of the Cursed group use. ... However, from the description it sounded as if Arthur had been an older gentleman, and the timeline of when he had first arrived at the Shelter didn't quite add up to the Cursed faction's founding.'Is there a relation between Arthur and Quinn? ... I should ask him about it. ... Perhaps there is a traitor in the Cursed faction that Quinn doesn't know about?' Nathan thought. ... \"Do you think Arthur is a V then? ... \" Nathan asked. ... Ruby gave him a look of utter confusion. ... When the others from the Shelter were asked the same thing, they reacted in the same way. ... It was clear they had no clue what a V was supposed to be.'Don't tell meâ¦'As it turned out, this Shelter had been cut off from the outside world for far longer than Nathan and the others had realised. ... They had next to no electronics that would allow them to see, or know about current or past events. ... \"The Demon tier weapon, where did you get it from? ... \" Nathan asked Ruby eventually. ... \"One Horn gave it to me after the battle. ... As for why he did that, your guess is as good as mine. ... I doubt he just did it because we helped the Dalki fight back against the military. ... I can only assume that he didn't consider me much of a threat, after all if even the Supreme Commander had been powerless against him, what chance would someone like me stand? ... \" Ruby explained. ... Nevertheless, the General thought there was more to it than that. ... One Horn must have known that given their plans of simultaneously attacking the planets he couldn't stay on this one forever. ... As such, Nathan assumed that he had done so to make sure they would keep their end of the deal with this mysterious Arthur. ... Dalki couldn't use beast gear, so leaving it to one of the people in the Shelter would boost their fighting power. ... Additionally, it had been a good way to sway those in the Shelter over to their side, building their trust. ... It was scary to consider that the Dalki were capable of more than mere violence and the efficiency of his actions was apparent. ... Even amongst the five they had 'rescued', there were those that seemed to be still untrusting of the military, only complying reluctantly, seemingly grateful to the Dalki that had helped them previously.'It's hard to blame them when the Earthborn group attacked them without giving it a second thought. ... In a way the Dalki are their saviours, but I still don't know what this Arthur could have given the Dalki to make them protect this Shelter...'Moving away from the others, Nathan decided to take Ruby to the side. ... He had noticed that during his questioning, she kept looking over at the others and even they seemed to be a bit nervous as if they were being careful with the way they answered certain questions. ... \"I think you know what I'm going to ask you. ... \" Nathan began, looking at the face she was pulling once more. ... \"I want to save the rest at your Shelter and bring them back to us. ... With your help, we can take down the Dalki. ... We know how strong their forces are. ... \"\"While it would have been risky before, now that we have recovered the Demon tier weapon, even the three spike Dalki will be easy to deal with. ... We have a great chance to do so with minimal lives lost. ... \" Nathan paused waiting for her to say something, but Ruby still remained silent. ... \"Look, Ruby, you have already given us all the information we could get from this place. ... You should understand that there is no logical reason for us to go and save the rest of your Shelter. ... It's been impossible to gather any information from the Dalki and I doubt that those left behind would know much anyway. ... I'm only doing this to try and right the wrong the military did to you all. ... \"\"We can't just leave this place, knowing that they have captured normal humans. ... \"Nathan was actually exaggerating here. ... Even with the Demon tier sword back in their possession, it might be hard to fight off the three spiked Dalki, at least in a frontal confrontation. ... On the other hand, if the five of them were to return, Ruby could use the weapon to strike him from behind. ... With him out of the equation, they would have the manpower to defeat the others with minimal losses. ... Of course, handing back the Demon tier weapon to Ruby was a risk. ... There was a chance she was still fighting for the other side so he needed to confirm her feelings, or what had been holding her back so far. ... \"I know, I know what you want me to do as well, but I can't. ... \" Ruby answered. ... \"Because, I don't know where my daughter isâ¦\"This was something that Nathan hadn't expected. ... This girl who he had come to learn was named Ruby, telling him they were using her daughter as a hostage. ... If the whole camp was being contained and protected, it would make no difference to put her daughter aside. ... After all, fighting against the Dalki, or trying to rebel wouldn't make a difference since the Dalki could just defeat them with ease, so why take a hostage? ... Trying to put himself in the shoes of the others, Nathan could only think of one thing. ... It was to make sure that the special deal they had made would still go through, in case he changed his mind. ... There had to be an external worry, and that couldn't be anyone in the camp, but must have had something to do with the initial goal of having those in the Shelter protected. ... They must have really wished for this Arthur person to be on their side no matter what.'The second Arthur made the request for the Dalki to protect this place, they knew they could use something to barter with him, yet what is it that he has that they want?'\"Maybe I will be speaking from a military point of view, but we are taught to not think on an individual basis. ... I know it might be wrong for me to say this because I am not in your position and not taking your feelings into account, but right now you are being quite selfish. ... \"Are your views the same as everyone else's? ... If everyone in your Shelter learned that there was a chance for all of their lives to be saved and for their life to return to normal, do you think they would dislike that? ... From what we've seen, it's clear that the Dalki don't treat you like equals. ... If you carry on the way you are now, soon you will be nothing but slaves. ... \"Nathan had said what he wanted to say, and now it was left up to Ruby to decide. ... He was sure there was a reason everyone looked up to her, and he was gambling that it was because she cared about the Shelter and their feelings. ... Ruby had gone off with the others, they were all allowed to converse as they naturally did, but time was running out. ... If they wanted the element of surprise to be on their side against the Dalki then they needed to do so now. ... It didn't take long, but Ruby had finally returned. ... \"Tell me what I need to do. ... \"A short while later, and the group of three hundred were put into action. ... They attacked the Shelter from multiple points in groups all at the same time. ... Due to the information they had received they were able to fare even better than they had originally believed. ... Once she had chosen to cooperate fully, Ruby had been able to give them information on the Dalki's patrol paths, and even tell them the times when they would be further split apart. ... Once their plan went into action Ruby had managed to play her part in everything splendidly. ... Rallying up those in the Shelter, and when coming out to 'help' The Dalki, she was able to use the Demon tier weapon to greatly injure the three spiked Dalki, albeit with tears in her eyes. ... While everything was going on, even higher in the trees, sitting on a branch out of sight from nearly everyone, was a person. ... \"Sir, it looks like the military have returned to this place once again. ... Those in the Shelter have seemingly betrayed the Dalki. ... Without One Horn present it looks like the humans will be able to achieve a victory this time. ... Would you like me to help out the Dalki side? ... \"\"No. ... Stay put. ... The outcome won't matter. ... He will be far too busy dealing with his own troubles, before he gets a chance to hear of this. ... \"*****\n",

      "When the Cursed ship was still in orbit, having yet to crash land on Planet Caladi, interesting things were happening. ... Peter had quickly suffered a defeat from Hilston. ... Hardly any strength had been used in the fight. ... Despite him being a Wight and having Quinn's stats, it all seemed like nothing against the one known as the world's strongest human. ... This was because he was also somewhat of a superhuman himself. ... Right now, every piece of equipment he wore on his body was shining brightly, as the properties of the Demon tier equipment were giving him additional stats. ... \"From your shouting, I thought you would amount to something at least, but I guess not,\" Hilston said. ... It was then when Peter felt like he had no hope to beat such a titan that something strange had occurred. ... Crashing through the ceiling of the training room and slamming down onto the ground, it felt like the whole ship had tilted on its side for a second. ... Something had landed in the centre of the training room. ... Looking at its back, Peter could tell it was a Dalki. ... He could see an unusually long tail, but worse of all, he had counted the number of spikes on its back.'How the hell did a five spike get in here?' Peter wondered. ... Looking above him, he could see a hole, but it didn't look to be a forced entry, almost as if someone had purposely made a hole so the Dalki would fall through to this exact spot. ... Seeing the tiny spiders at work and repairing the ceiling, Peter could only assume it was the work of Logan.'I will have to thank him once again for saving my life for a second time.' Peter thought. ... Thankfully, his wounds had healed from the attack he had received. ... The good thing was that Peter hadn't been repeatedly hurt, so his hunger hadn't started to grow yet, but seeing the situation as it was, Peter soon found himself walking towards the side of the doors. ... As expected, one of them had opened, but only for him. ... Logan really was watching everything that was going on the ship.'I hope the two of you kill each other.' Peter left because he knew staying there for any amount of time would be so at the risk of his own life. ... The five spiked Dalki was a female Dalki known as Slicer. ... Her tail would constantly sway back and forth, similar to a dog. ... It was a sign she was overjoyed at the moment. ... \"I knew something was here! ... \" Slicer declared with a big smile. ... \"A strong energy unlike any other was calling to me, and now that I have seen you, I know exactly what it is. ... It's that armour! ... It's radiating with strength even now! ... \"While Slicer was still overjoyed at finding such a great person in front of her. ... Hilston wasted no time launching an attack. ... A streak of constant lightning soon had struck Slicer's body. ... Once it was done, it didn't stop there. ... Hilston continued to pour his MC cells into the attack. ... \"Why is an ugly lizard getting in my way now of all things! ... \" Hilston said as he added more power to the attack. ... The whole room soon was filled with blue lighting, so much that if one was to enter, they would have been unable to see the Dalki or anything else for that matter. ... Still, after a while, Hilton hadn't stopped his attack, and it was because he could tell something was up. ... Soon coming through the giant lightning attack, he could see a shadow walking towards him slowly, the tail shaking back and forth intensely. ... The next second, a gap in the lighting could be seen. ... It was strange, it looked like the lightning strike had been cut, but Hilston hadn't seen anything of the sort. ... Refusing to believe that the Dalki was unaffected by such an attack, Hilston tried to use his lightning strike again. ... Regardless of this, a cut had been made in the lighting again, and Slicer was seen continuing to walk forward. ... This time paying more attention, Hilston had seen it. ... For a brief second, her tail had stopped wagging back and forth. ... He could only assume that the tail was involved in disrupting the lightning. ... \"Excellent. ... \" Slicer said. ... \"You are the one after all. ... \"The attack wasn't ineffective. ... Just Slicer was too overjoyed and too focused to let something as minor as pain ruin her joyous moment. ... She dashed forward with a scream, clearly intending to attack.'A punch, or a kick, my armour will deal with those things.' Hilston thought, planning to match the attack with his own strength. ... However, for a second, he had seen the tail stop for a moment. ... He had a feeling he knew what was about to happen, and something told him he needed to avoid it at all cost. ... The tail had struck, making no noise at all. ... It was back in place, swinging as it had done before. ... In front of Slicer, she had expected to see a sliced up old man, but her tail had hit nothing but air. ... Before she knew it, a giant fist of flames was coming at her and had punched her on her side underneath her arm. ... Hilston had swung his fist like a hook and had used the firepower like a jet from his elbow to give the punch as much strength as possible. ... It had worked, and Slicer was soon seen flying through the air. ... Until she had dug her tail into the ground, but it was too sharp and had done nothing but just cut the ground like butter, not slowing her down for a second. ... Before she crashed into the wall, Hilston was soon seen behind her, aiming to deliver this time, two jet fire punches in her back. ... With as fast as the Dalki went through the air, it would mean even more power to a strike. ... \"I get it now. ... No human can move that fast. ... You must be using an ability. ... \" Slicer said. ... \"But you're too predictable! ... \"It was then that she attacked with her tail behind her. ... She could tell it had hit something solid, but for the first time, her tail was stuck. ... It hadn't gone through the object or the person she was aiming at. ... Hilston was only briefly sent through the air. ... He was able to use his teleportation ability to reposition himself again. ... Slicer was right. ... Hilston was using the power of teleportation to move. ... He could dodge attacks instantly and move as far as his eyes could see, as many times as he wanted consecutively.'That blow, it was one hit, but it charged up the Demon tier equipment this much already?' Hilston thought, looking at his gauntlets. ... At the same time, Slicer was smiling, for she could feel that part of her scales from where Hilston had hit her, had fallen and she was bleeding slightly.'This is it. ... This is exactly what I need! ... \" Slicer shouted in pleasure. ... She charged in again, going for the attack, and as expected, Hilston started to teleport around the room. ... Before he could teleport, he struck a lightning strike at her wound. ... Then, when appearing by her side or back, he would use flame filled attacks. ... One after another. ... Doing this constantly at a fast speed, Slicer couldn't catch a break, but the more she got injured, the stronger she was getting. ... Soon, her tail was being used more than she had ever had to in a fight before. ... Hitting Hilston with great speed each time he appeared. ... Her tail had never been stopped by anything before. ... Yet today, It had constantly failed to cut the strong special diamond armour.'This is it, this fight. ... The fight where I have to fight with my life on the line. ... This is the fight that will allow me to evolve!' She thought. ... It was then that Hilston was finding something oddly strange. ... With his attacks, he wasn't holding back. ... Anyone would have been killed with a single hit, but this Dalki was still standing, and her attacks were getting stronger and faster. ... For a second, Hilston was reminded of the last fight he had lost. ... Something was coming over him. ... It wasn't like when he fought the other one, and was so overpowered that he was unable to do anything. ... No, instead, this felt like a wall that was continuing to grow larger and more robust. ... \"No... ... I will not lose again! ... \" Hilston shouted. ... His armour had now charged up, and he was finally ready to use one of the pieces of its active skill. ... However, it was at this point that the ship had crashed. ... Trying to not get hurt, Hilston teleported away to safety while the ship continued to bounce across the sand. ... At one point, Slicer appeared above and dug her feet into his shoulders.'While I'm in contact with another, I can't teleport!' Hilston angrily thought. ... He soon was seen being pulled out of the ship, with blood dripping from his traps, covering the shoulders of his armour. ... When they were a distance away from the ship. ... Hilston grabbed the legs, and the armour around his arms started to glow. ... They had delivered a strange pulse. ... A strange feeling had come over the Dalki, making it drop Hilston into the sand. ... With Hilston safely landing as well. ... Slicer quickly landed herself and stood opposite the Dalki, but her joyous face from before had disappeared. ... \"You, you need to get stronger. ... You need to hurt me more. ... Otherwise, I won't evolve. ... If I can evolve, I will be ahead of the others and can be the overall leader of the Dalki. ... So hurt me, hurt me more! ... \" She shouted. ... \"You think you're a challenge to me. ... You were never a challenge in the first place. ... \" Hilston said, as he activated the Demon tier armour set active skill.*******\n",

      "The drones being used to livestream the fight between the 'strongest human' and one of the Dalki leaders weren't ordinary. ... In fact, both Bonny and Void had invested their life savings into purchasing these robots. ... The two of them had started together from the bottom. ... They used to be no names in the entertainment industry and rather than going through the traditional means, they had decided to build themselves from the ground up by starting their own channel and news outlet. ... It was only later they had been picked up and given a dedicated live channel that could be broadcasted on world channels as well. ... Through the years they had learned a lot, and over the years had continued to reinvest their earnings into their equipment, making their reporting game above anyone else. ... Besides they were after all, one of the few daring enough to put themselves in dangerous situations. ... Each one of Void's drones might have cost an arm and a leg, but they were literally the best money could buy, able to survive through thunderstorms and more. ... Nevertheless, it didn't mean they were indestructible, nothing in the world was, but they could take quite the beating under normal circumstances. ... Of course, any one attack from Slicer or Hilston would be more than enough to take them out, but thankfully Void's control over them was superb. ... He moved them as if they were extensions of his own body, allowing him to get them in the right places to offer the best viewing experience while simultaneously keeping them out of the danger zone. ... His concentration was always in top shape, it helped due to how much these drones cost in the first place. ... So far, the drones had survived all the chaos, taking the whole world along for the ride. ... Filming every aspect of the fight since the Cursed ship. ... \"Did you see the powers that Blade person used? ... Teleportation, Fire and Lightning! ... Each one of them was top tier! ... \"\"Top tier? ... Have we been watching the same fight? ... That was far beyond the top tier! ... Why would a person this strong stay hidden this whole time? ... With his power he could have had anything he wanted! ... \"\"I know they are saying he's done bad things, but does it really matter at this moment. ... We need everyone we can to fight against the Dalki. ... \"Those online were fascinated by the strong powers displayed by Hilston Blade and despite Bonny revealing the Blade family's negative past, the support of the people was with him. ... In a way, it was natural when seeing a human fight against a Dalki that the public would be on his side. ... Out of the two, Slicer was the first to make her next move, by dashing forward again. ... To the viewers it appeared as if she was simply repeating the same pattern over and over. ... One would think that she hadn't learned her lesson, but as her opponent, Hilston could feel the difference. ... Each time, one of them was able to catch a break. ... The fighting positions of them both reset to how they first started. ... Despite the moves being the same, Slicer came at him slightly stronger each time. ... This time, Hilston did something different hoping to change the outcome. ... He moved his hand and the next second a giant wave of sand could be seen swallowing Slicer whole, but just like everything else so far, the Dalki leader used her tail to cut through the obstacle to reach her target. ... However, following after the sand was part of the ship that was being hurled at her again and again. ... Large and small pieces of all shapes and sizes, They wern;t being thrown one by one either. ... Multiple parts were moving in all sorts of different directions. ... She was able to avoid or take most of the blows head on. ... Some of the times would simply bounce off her hard skin, but for a second, she could feel that her tail had slowed down.'What is this strange force I can feel. ... Is it an ability? ... For me to actually feel a difference...' Slicer was quite surprised. ... Pushing through with her strength she could move her tail still, the Dalki cut another wave of sand, only to find a piece of metal from the ship hitting her with great force, more so than all the items before, and lifting her into the air.'It's best not to show your entire strength.' Hilston thought with a smile, pleased how his simple plan had worked out. ... Whenever, Hilston got the chance, he would rain down lightning on the Dalki like he was doing now in the air, but for the first time it looked as if this ability was completely ineffective.'I knew it, this person still has tricks up his sleeve! ... Yes, this is what I was waiting for!' Slicer thought, a pleased distorted smile on her face. ... 'The lightning attacks hardly harm my body anymore, but they must be draining his energy.'Not many people had fought against a five spike Dalki or had lived to get up close to one and speak again. ... So they had no way of knowing that five spikes were a little different. ... Their bodies would be altered slightly. ... The scales on their outer body tripled in thickness and strength, making most attacks feel like nothing, which was why the lightning wasn't affecting Slicer in the same way it would have done others. ... \"That ability he just used, that had to have been Telekinesis, right? ... That would make it the fourth ability he has used so far! ... \" Someone commented on the livestream. ... In the air, Slicer soon slashed the metal object that was propelling her into the air. ... She had split it up into several parts, but didn't expect for now all the separate pieces to be going towards her. ... Moving her tail even faster she continued to cut them into smaller and smaller pieces until they were no longer moving. ... Now mid air, she started to fall, until from her back, large wings sprouted. ... Wings were already a rarity among the Dalki, yet Slicer was even more unique in that she was able to retract them at will. ... For the first time, the female Dalki changed her tactics. ... Rather than attacking Hilston by running straight forward from the ground, she was making use of her wings and flew at him at a speed faster than her previous top one. ... \"Come on, most of your attacks still haven't been able to even hurt me that bad! ... \" Slicer taunted her opponent. ... Hilston knew that she wasn't lying. ... So far, the only thing that had been effective, had been the fire ability mixed in with his natural raw strength supported from the demon tier armour. ... Unfortunately, getting a hold of her had proven to be a real headache. ... Planting his first into the lizard's body would be a hard task. ... Given how fast Slicer currently was, it was incredibly hard for the strongest human to physically hit her. ... Fortunately, the lightning attacks moved at speed surpassing hers, just like the telekinesis ability which was why Hilston didn't show any signs of panic. ... Still these were ineffective which was why he was at a standstill. ... When Slicer was close enough, around an arm's reach away, a large pulse radiated from his armour. ... The force itself could be seen as a ripple moving through the sky. ... It didn't move fast, nor did it spread out too wide, but for those inside its range, it was impossible to escape the attack. ... Just like everything Slicer had seen before, she attempted to slash through this invisible pulse. ... When the tip of her tail touched it, an instinct surfaced which she hadn't felt in a long time.'This, it was exactly the same skill he had used when I had him held up in the air.' She thought. ... When it passed through her whole body, there was nothing she could do. ... Her body became unable to move and the female Dalki was falling down. ... However, whilst in mid-air Hilston followed up with a double hammer fist of flames, slamming her into the ground making a tide of sand shoot up into the sky. ... The livestream that was being shown to the viewers played out a frame rate that was usually used to film slow motion videos. ... Otherwise, many wouldn't be able to fathom what was going on, and would be unable to see such a lightning fast fight in real life, but they could all see it through the screen. ... It was unbelievable everything they were seeing at the event was nail biting for them all. ... They were unsure just what was going to happen next or how it would all play out.******\n",

      "The strange pulse that was felt coming from Hilston had stopped Slicer in her tracks. ... As soon as it hit her, a tingling feeling was felt in her body that she just couldn't shake off and soon, she felt her whole body going numb. ... This was what had allowed her to receive a devastating blow. ... Still, it didn't take long after the attack for Slicer to dig her way out of the sand, even though Hilston was using his Telekinesis to bury her deeper by the second. ... She was soon seen shooting out from the ground, blood falling from her back, and it partially seared from the attack. ... \"That one hurt a bit! ... You got anymore like that in you?! ... \" Slicer continued her taunting, before she jumped into the air once more. ... The five spiked Dalki was far more injured than she herself realised and her body had started to tilt during her flight, making her come in at an odd angle, but it didn't matter to her. ... Hilston activated his Demon tier's Armour special set skill once more and the pulse went outward. ... Although she couldn't see the attack, she could feel that the armour had done something and remembering what had just happened, she tried to find a gap of some sort. ... The invisible pulse was coming out like a bubble hitting everything in the area. ... Only a slight change could be seen if one was to look closely similar to a heatwave on a hot day. ... Slicer flapped her wings with all her power in an attempt to get outside of its possible range, but eventually she got hit, causing her body to freeze again. ... With Hilston's Teleportation ability, he was soon in front of her, and happily delivered another flame punch to her face. ... After teleporting again, his next punch was aimed at her side and he continued to pummel her. ... The teleportation attacks with the flame punches were proving to be effective. ... Getting hit another time, Slicer's anger had risen and she bore through the effects swinging her tail out at the same time, hearing a familiar clang. ... That was the sign that his active skill had stopped working, and Hilston increased the distance between the two of them again. ... \"You damn cheat! ... Stop running away and fight me fair and square! ... \" Slicer demanded in her fury, her appearance looking more and more like a piece of charcoal. ... \"My armour is merely a tool, just like my abilities, as are your wings and your tail. ... There is no honour in a fight, just a winner! ... \" Hilston stated. ... What he was using was the active armour skill called Disruptive pulse. ... It was a set of Demon tier armour all with the same skill. ... However, its range and area where it worked was limited if one only had one part of the Demon tier set. ... For example, the armour covering his hands only allowed him to use the skill on physical touch, which was what he had done the first time, but when having the whole armour set on, one could affect everything in a certain area. ... Disruptive pulse was a Demon tier active skill that even Hilston didn't know every use of. ... So far it had stopped any ability that was touched by the pulse, a person's actions, beasts and more. ... This Demon tier set was perfect for someone like Hilston, allowing him to use his strongest moves against his enemies while they were frozen in place, at the same time, disrupting his opponents most powerful moves. ... Nevertheless, there was a small downside to it. ... The armour he was wearing needed to be charged up, something that only happened after it had received a certain amount of damage. ... The stronger the opponent, the quicker that happened and only then was he able to use the active skills. ... The watching community was going crazy cheering on Hilston to beat the five spiked Dalki. ... They had yet to really grasp Slicer's strength, so most could not truly understand the great feat that was happening at the moment. ... Hilston continued to fight in this style using the active skill and his strong abilities, mainly the fire one to pound his enemy, his fists were seen being covered in green blood. ... Even though Slicer's strength was rising, it didn't matter as she had yet to find a way to get out of the pulse. ... Each time it went through her body she became defenceless, unable to fight against it. ... Given her personality and pride as a Dalki leader she wasn't one to run away either, but finally, for some reason, Hislton had stopped using it; he had stopped using the pulse. ... This was first noticed by Slicer when her attack had gotten through and it wasn't just a hit out of desperation this time. ... Still, it had only clashed against his armour. ... Hilston had blocked the attack from his head, another attack followed up from Slicer and he barely blocked that one too. ... The third strike came at an angle that would be impossible to block, so instead the Blade leader teleported away. ... Slicer, slightly surprised about the sudden reversal, quickly figured out the situation. ... Then she started to laugh to herself. ... \"Now I understand. ... You can't do that weird thing anymore, can you? ... \" Slicer questioned him, yet Hilston didn't bother to give her an answer. ... There was no need for it either as the circumstances spoke for themselves. ... Hilston had long since expected the Dalki to fall before him, but she had proven far more resilient than he had ever anticipated, able to survive even his strongest abilities. ... This was the very first time someone had been able to last long enough that the charges of Disruptive pulse had actually run out. ... Now he was forced to stay on the defensive and wait for the attacks to charge it back up. ... Which was why he was also reluctant to use his teleportation ability. ... It was then that Slicer did something strange that no one had expected. ... Using her long tail, she aimed at the base, the tip skimmed around the edge, and the next second it could be seen falling into the sand. ... Blood started to spew everywhere, dying the sand green. ... The wound quickly healed, until she let out a shriek and a new tail grew in its place. ... Slicer quickly did this two more times, chopping off her tails, regrowing a new one, each one looking more impressive than the last and even longer. ... Then picking up both of her tails, she held them in her hands. ... It was a gruesome sight to see, a Dalki using its own body part as some type of weapon, but at the same time, for those watching it just sent a shiver down their spine. ... Showing just how blood hungry they were, to not even give it a second thought to do such a thing. ... \"Why won't that thing die! ... So much of its blood has been split! ... \" A viewer commented. ... \"I haven't gotten to a six spike yet, So I need to push myself even further! ... \" Slicer said, with bloodshot eyes. ... Although her approach seemed to be a double-edged sword, her current tail was double the size of the one had originally had but even she didn't know how much longer she would last with so little Dalki blood left inside her.ââNot too far away from where the fight was taking place, A small group could be seen walking in the sand. ... \"It looks like everyone who was around the Cursed ship has left this place. ... \" Fex commented. ... Looking at the dead human and Dalki bodies around. ... Most of them were the Chained, but there were a few humans from the Cursed group as well. ... Fex was soon seen wrapping them up, mummifying them with his string. ... His strings even though they looked light, could be used as quite the weight. ... On the way back, they would make sure to give their bodies a proper funeral. ... Right now, the members of the cursed faction had an important job to do, and among them was determined Sil, who was ready to make his move.******Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "After dealing with the threat of the Dalki in the Shelter, the Cursed members had finally been able to catch a break for a bit. ... Without the fighting it even seemed peaceful as long as one didn't think about what was currently happening on the other human planets. ... The place had already been evacuated beforehand, but with only those from the Cursed ship currently occupying the Shelter, it resembled a ghost town. ... \"Has the fighting really ended. ... Is it safe? ... \" Someone asked. ... \"I guess so. ... Wouldn't the Dalki be coming out now if it wasn't the case? ... \" Another replied. ... The people were discussing the shocking events that had occurred to them. ... Some were cursing in anger, while others were in tears. ... Everyone was happy that they had just narrowly escaped death, but now that they were all safe, they had time to really process the loss of their close friends and loved ones. ... Many were running around the Shelter delivering the good news, while also trying to find those close to them. ... It was a large place after all. ... Still, everything just felt a bit unorganised. ... \"So, what are we going to do now? ... \" Fex asked. ... \"Should we round up everyone and head back to the Cursed ship? ... I bet Logan can repair it given enough time. ... \"When the question was asked, it was naturally directed towards Quinn. ... Unfortunately, the Cursed faction leader had gone back to acting as his weird self. ... \"It's really not my place to say, but if you still want my opinion, then I would suggest that the best thing to do is to meet up with Sam. ... He usually has a clear head on what to do next, and as for the... ... let's say 'real Quinn', you don't have to worry about him. ... As long as this body remains in a safe place then everything will be fine. ... \"Vincent was unable to see what was happening to the Dalki body Quinn was occupying, nor did he know where his grandson was right now. ... However, what he did know was that the energy in his Vampire Lord's body was no longer being drained. ... Without that burden, Vincent was surprised given the rate Quinn's body was producing energy, making him wonder if it had anything to do with the special Qi, or perhaps it was something else.'I guess Quinn must have managed to deal with his enemy on his side, but if that was true, why hasn't he returned?'It didn't take long for the group to locate Sam and the others, as Vincent still remembered where they had previously been. ... Layla and Nate were also back on their feet again. ... Nevertheless, neither one was in any real fighting condition. ... While they walked on their own, they did so with sore muscles, aches, pains and more. ... When the two groups met up, Sam was taken aback. ... In particular due to the presence of two familiar looking faces with blonde hair. ... \"Don't worry, they have decided to stay with us and promised to behave. ... \" Vorden explained. ... Although Raten didn't exactly seem pleased, Sam trusted those around them to keep an eye on the twins. ... Especially Borden, who was back to regular human size, made it clear that he was watching their every move. ... On the way to Sam, there had already been a few times that Borden had mistaken their actions and warned them. ... Neither one of the two had been pleased, but both of them understood that the vigilance wasn't unfounded. ... \"I've already contacted Logan and he said that a few repairs have to be made before the Cursed ship will be able to fly again. ... \" Sam shared with the group. ... \"Unfortunately, the teleporters don't seem to be working in the Shelter, just like in all the other places I guess. ... According to the information we have received, there has to be some type of jammer on the mothership. ... \"\"Then let's take down the ship! ... \" Raten suggested in a fighting mood. ... Looking around though, there weren't really many that were in fighting condition, even when Sam met up with Vincent he shook his head insinuating it was a bad idea. ... \"Actually, I think I might be able to help with that. ... \" Vincent remembered there was something that Quinn had done, and perhaps it could be used now more than ever. ... Using the dimensional space soon a strange long stick with a large crystal on the end appeared in front of everyone. ... It was clear to them all it was something they had never seen before. ... It took a few seconds until Sam was the first one to catch on to the strange design of the object. ... \"Thatâ¦ is that Dalki tech? ... It uses the same black material and the engraved swirls and spikes. ... \" Sam theorised, pointing towards the top. ... \"Quinnâ¦ ahem, when 'I' was on the mothership, I decided to place it in my shadow. ... I thought that maybe we could use it to create a jammer of some type. ... \" Vincent explained, catching himself in the moment. ... Since he had yet to explain to the new group they had now met up with. ... By now, everyone was already aware that this person in front of them wasn't the 'real Quinn'. ... However, the fact that he was in his body and continued to help them made them trust whoever it was enough to continue playing along. ... In the first place, it didn't seem likely that they would get a better answer, unless Vincent decided to spill the beans himself. ... \"I think it would be best if we hand this over to Logan. ... He was already doing research into the situation. ... With this thing, maybe he can figure something out. ... The people should stay inside the Shelter. ... It's relatively safe for now. ... Dennis, Megan, Shiro, I want you three to stay behind. ... For one, someone still needs to look after these two. ... \" Sam pointed at Layla and Nate, who looked sad, but neither one argued, aware of their own situation. ... \"On top of that, make sure the Blade kids don't do anything either. ... Although they are with Grim, he isn't in the best shape either. ... I know you are good at dealing with them, Shiro. ... If the place is attacked I need you to report it ASAP to us. ... The rest of us will head to the Cursed ship. ... \"The group followed Sam's orders, so they headed to the Cursed ship. ... Sam thought that perhaps they would need some strength to deal with the Dalki that had boarded the Cursed ship. ... He had considered the possibility of running into a bunch of them, so he felt a little safer with the people who were by his side, but just like Borden, he couldn't yet completely trust the two newcomers, Pai and Vicky. ... When arriving, the site turned out to be nothing like they had expected. ... All of the Dalki had already been dealt with. ... Their dead bodies lay scattered around the ground in the sand. ... Entering the Cursed ship, they were greeted to a similar scene inside. ... It was a sad sight to behold, for a lot of them this place had been their home, yet now it was ruined, most places no longer even recognisable. ... When reaching Logan, in the command centre, they were happy to see that he was safe. ... Handing over the strange device, Logan became overjoyed and got to work almost immediately. ... However, the group noticed something playing in the command centre, something that Logan had been watching this entire time. ... Several eyes in the room lit up, and their hearts beat harder as they saw it, it was the fight against Slicer and Hilston. ... \"Hilston, he's winning. ... \" Vicky said, her body shaking, her mind was a bit of a loss of what to do. ... Pai, who had gained consciousness a while ago, was just staring at the screen having no such reactions. ... Until he noticed something before the others. ... \"You need to stop him! ... \" Pai pleaded as he turned around, looking towards Vorden. ... Vorden wasn't sure what the other expected him to do, but he suddenly noticed that someone had gone missing from their group. ... \"Goddamnit, where is Sil?! ... \"Everyone turned around, but he was nowhere to be seen, so most of the Cursed group quickly headed outside to search for him, leaving Logan to do what needed to be done. ... \"What is he planning to do now? ... \" Fex grumbled. ... \"Isn't it obvious? ...

      "The Cursed group were standing on top of a large sand dune. ... In the distance, they were able to see the fighting that was still ongoing at this very moment. ... The participants didn't seem to notice their presence, either because the group was too far away, or because they were forced to fully concentrate on their opponent. ... The fight was heating up with every passing second, and large explosions of power were being released one after another. ... The Cursed group was still within a distance that allowed them to smell the blood coming off Hilston and the Dalki, at least those that were vampires. ... They had been standing there for a while now and had witnessed Hilston get the upper hand over Slicer due to his Demon tier armour's active skill. ... \"That skill is so strong, I wonder what it would do to my strings? ... \" Fex wondered. ... \"I could just walk through it, it's the hard armor that I'm impressed with. ... \" Peter replied. ... Hearing this, Pai couldn't help but laugh at the two of them. ... \"That skill is extremely powerful. ... Not only would your strings fall to the floor or disintegrate but the second that pulse went through your bodies you would be unable to feel anything. ... It's impossible to fight it, and at the same time, as you can see, not even that Dalki can cut through the armour. ... \"\"Shut up you big brain, you're in the same situation as us. ... \" Raten complained. ... \"You know, if he turns to us, I'm telling them you joined our side, so get ready to fight for your life, and use that knowledge to beat him. ... \"Pai quickly went silent, and their eyes were back on the fight. ... However, they noticed that Hilston's advantage had suddenly disappeared, and for a while now, he had gone on the defensive, both sides seemed to be struggling greatly. ... Slicer, using two seperated tails as whips, was swinging them at a speed just as great as she would use her own tail, but thanks to Hilston's teleportation, he could quickly escape, and try his best to attack using his abilities. ... Getting in close, he would use the telekinesis to slow down the attack. ... He did so after a swing from one of Slicer's tails and threw out a fist of his own. ... However, using the enormous tail she had regrown, Slicer wrapped around Hilston and was gripping on to him tightly. ... Trying to get out of the situation, Hilston's whole body was lighting up in flames, until eventually Slicer had no choice but to let go. ... Even through her skin, the fire seemed to be getting stronger and would eventually even affect her unlike the lightning attacks. ... Nevertheless, she didn't give up and threw one of her tails like a spear straight towards Hilston. ... Lifting up his hands, he stopped it mid-flight, but was too slow to see the large tail, sweeping below and going in for the attack again and again. ... The good news was, it was just hitting his armour and unable to damage him. ... \"This fight is crazy. ... They seem to have already surpassed most Vampire family leaders. ... \" Fex commented with his mouth left wide open. ... It was now moving at an unprecedented pace and all of those watching imagined themselves on the receiving end of any of these attacks. ... All of them estimated that they might get defeated in a matter of seconds. ... The power of the big four were in Hilston's hands, and they were even boosted and stronger, yet he was still unable to take out the Dalki. ... This wasn't the only thing, even Hilston's physical strength could match the vampire leaders. ... Peter knew this for a fact, because he had felt the power behind just one of Hilston's hits. ... If one was to watch the sand around them carefully they could tell, because with each punch, the sand was being dragged and lifted, thrown all over the place. ... \"You told me to come over to your side, but can you see now why I can't? ... \" Vicky questioned as she clenched her fist. ... Everyone could hear what she was saying but none got involved because this was a matter for the members of the Blade family. ... \"He is the strongest in the world! ... That Dalki is covered in blood and might be putting up a good fight, but she still can't even scratch him! ... Do you really think you can do anything against such a monster, Sil? ... \" Vicky continued to speak, expecting an answer. ... Although both members of the family, neither Vorden nor Raten considered this to be a place for them to say anything. ... Instead, they looked at Sil who had both his hands clenched and was looking at the fight, waiting for the right time to make a move.'I wonder what you are thinking, Sil. ... It's always been hard to understand you.' Vorden thought. ... Despite the fact that Hilston could no longer use his active skill Disruptive pulse, he was fighting better than he had done before with the use of the abilities. ... There were a lot of people that were worried about him once they had seen Slicer separate her tails to grow the current enormous one. ... By using the ones she had discarded as weapons, it was now as if Hilston was fighting against three different Slicers. ... However, just like Slicer had been growing proportionate to the damage she had received, something similar was happening to Hilston, who was fighting with his life on the line. ... Rather than using the abilities raw powers to finish off his opponents, he had to try to come up with combinations. ... He was forced to use his head to a degree. ... He could even feel the cells in his body growing more active. ... His survival instincts were kicking in and rather than his body choosing to run away, it was using this fight to allow the strongest human to grow even stronger. ... Unknown to him, these cells activating through his whole body were Qi. ... Qi, beyond anyone's imagination, was running through him making him superhuman. ... This was why he could match up to Slicer for so long.'The Blade family will always keep growing, and even now we will get stronger and stronger!' Hilston thought. ... 'Soon the armour will be charged again, and once the Disruptive pulse is ready, I will finish this oversized lizard off!'At that moment, meeting up with the others on the sand dune were Bonny and Void. ... Void had his camera out and straight away zoomed in on the action that was going on in front of them. ... He didn't greet the others, or explain anything, he would let Bonny do the talking. ... \"What are the two of you doing here? ... Didn't I tell you to stay in the Shelter? ... \" Sam questioned, shocked and also a little angry, they decided to ignore his orders. ... The two of them looked safe having no injuries on their body, but if there was even a single Dalki they had missed, the two of them could have easily died. ... \"We've lost two of our drones. ... It's getting more intense and even with Void's control they were hit. ... There is a good chance that all of the cameras will be lost if it continues. ... Practically everyone is watching this fight and we can't just sit around and not deliver its conclusion! ... \" Bonny explained, making it apparent that they would stay here, their pride as reporters demanding it. ... Sam sighed and agreed to their request, but refused to comment on anything while the fight was going on, to the camera that was. ... He soon saw one of the drones returning, now there was one drone filming the fight, and Void's personal camera, while the drone that returned was looking at the Cursed members. ... Inside the lab where Graham and Quinn were present they could see the camera view switch. ... For a second the camera had panned over to all those in the Cursed faction that were watching the fight. ... Bonny wanted to get the live reactions of them all. ... This allowed Quinn to see his own body.'Vincent, I told you to protect them, what are you doing bringing them to such a place?' Quinn thought, wanting to slap his forehead. ... The Dalki looked to be heavily injured and covered in blood. ... Seeing this Quinn smiled thinking that even a five spike could be injured. ... However his smile quickly disappeared as he remembered that the Cursed faction were in a huge mess due to Hilston in the first place, and if Hilston was to win, he would soon be after them straight after. ... \"Was that a smile, are you smiling because you think your own race is going to lose? ... \" Graham asked. ... ******\n",

      "\"I didn't believe it, but you're really rooting against your own kind? ... Seeing one of us turn traitor is interesting in its own way and I look forward to finding out one way or the other what they did to you. ... Still, let me ask you, do you really think that Slicer will lose? ... \" Graham asked. ... Hearing this, Quinn thought that Graham was oddly confident. ... It was hard to tell through camera the sheer battle that was going on, but Quinn thought for sure that Slicer had to be at her limit, especially after she had seemingly fallen into a frenzied state making her harm herself. ... Now experiencing fighting as a Dalki, Quinn could guess how far a Dalki could push themselves, even with the added energy from blood loss, and strength it could only take them so far. ... \"She can push herself further. ... Maybe one more will do. ... \" Graham mumbled. ... \"That Demon tier Armour has been troublesome, but we are stronger than Demon tier beasts. ... \"Hearing this, from someone who Quinn had suffered a humiliating defeat against, he could believe it. ... However, they were going against a man that had a full set of Demon tier Armour, this person was also stronger than Demon tier beasts.ââIt was then, for the third time in the fight, that Slicer chose to hurt herself. ... Her latest tail proved to be more resilient than the previous ones, forcing her to attack it multiple times, before it fell to the ground. ... Without the Disruptive pulse, Hislton was being careful to get close. ... After all, all he needed to do was bide his time. ... More blood stained the ground and it took a while for another tail to replace the old one. ... Through the blood loss, she felt her mind hazing. ... In order to snap out of it, she stomped both feet on the ground. ... Screaming soon after, the tail could be seen moving, it was the original size of the first one, but didn't stop there. ... Under her pained shrieks it slowly continued to elongate until reaching three times her body size. ... The scales on her body had been ruined, her inner bones had been broken multiple times but had healed again and again. ... Her energy was at an all-time high, but she was struggling to keep her mind clear. ... Still her eyesight was set on the enemy in front of her. ... She could practically feel the sixth spike coming after defeating him. ... 'It's there... ... I know it's there.. ... I will be the first one.. ... the strongest one!'Charging in like she had done before, she was ready to come in, and when she was within range, she spun her body, and the large tails spun with her, at the last second the large tail connected to her, extended out coming down on Hilston like a hammer.'This is it, with this attack, the armour will be charged again!' Hilston believed, teleporting into place, and raising his arms so they were in the right position. ... He had a huge grin on his face as he was ready to use Disruptive pulse the moment it would be available. ... However, this time there was no 'clang' sound at all. ... Instead, his hands were no longer attached to his body, cut off cleanly they were now lying in the sand. ... It didn't stop there, as the colossal tail was used for another strike. ... Following his instincts, Hilston didn't even try to use an ability, instead jumping back. ... Despite its size, Slicer's newest tail was faster than any of the others. ... It hit the chest piece, leaving behind a giant slash, from which diamonds dropped to the ground. ... As this happened, Hilston could feel the accumulated energy fade away. ... Using the distance he had just won, Hilston teleported himself out of there, as far as he could. ... It was done in a panic and he didn't really register that he was falling back. ... Seeing this, Slicer extended her tail and swung her body in a circle, cutting everything around, another clang was heard, and Hilston was seen being flung through the air, falling to the ground. ... His armour that he had worn this whole time had been cut in half. ... Due to how heavy it was, it had fallen off him falling to the ground. ... Now a large wound was visible across his entire torso, painting it red. ... \"The Dalki, it's gotten so much stronger. ... \" Sam gasped. ... \"Hilston, he'sâ¦he's going to lose! ... \"\"No, that can't be! ... How could he lose to a lizard like that?! ... He was just caught off guard, he had to be tired after how long they were fighting for. ... \" Vicky sounded like she was now making up excuses for him. ... \"That's not it. ... I've never seen Hilston take a fight so seriously before. ... \" Pai spoke. ... \"If it was the old Hilston, he would have lost this fight a lot sooner, but he actually fought with great tactics, his moves were faster and he had access to some of the strongest abilities in the world. ... It's justâ¦ the power of the Dalki was stronger.. ... \" It was something hard to admit, and even though her twin brother Pai was saying these words, she still didn't believe it. ... Hilston had to still have something up his sleeve, something that would turn this fight around, she just knew it. ... Void soon zoomed the camera into Hilston's wound, his body was far more hurt then the others thought as well. ... They could see it now the armour had fallen off. ... Despite the armour he was wearing, his body was swollen and bruised from all the attacks, all showing different colours. ... Despite blocking them his body still ended up like this. ... The force of the blows were unimaginable. ... That was when on the camera itself, it had picked a certain person, who was standing there by Hilston side. ... It appeared suddenly. ... They could only see the back of his head, but the others knew who it was. ... \"Sil! ... \" Sam shouted out. ... Sam wanted to stop him, but he knew that if he tried to get in Sil's way what could he honestly do. ... No amount of thinking in this situation would help them.ââ\"Isn't this one of the ones from the Cursed faction? ... I've seen them fighting a few times on Bonny's live stream. ... \" A user commented. ... \"Yeah I think she said that he was a Blade as well, only working for the Cursed faction. ... Has he come to help? ... \"\"With the two of them, maybe they can defeat the five spiked Dalki. ... Yeah, we can win this fight, beating one of their strongest! ... \"\"But if he's actually strong, then why did he come join the fight only now? ... Couldn't he have come to support the Blade guy in the middle of it? ... Also, why is he just standing there? ... \"The online community was in high spirits, until they could see Sil looking at Hilston on the ground, not turning to look at the Dalki for even a second. ... At the same time the spinning from Slicer's attack had caused her to be slightly wobbly on her feet as well. ... She knew the condition her opponent was in, so he wasn't going anywhere soon.ââ\"I've always dreamed about this moment. ... I've thought about what I would say to you, if I ever got this chance. ... For the longest time, I just wanted you to tell me why you did everything you did. ... Why you decided to put everyone through that on Blade Island. ... There had to be a reason, right? ... A reason that could justify your actions... ... but is there really anything that can justify everything you did? ... One day, the hope inside me that there might be one, just disappeared, so there is no point asking you that. ... \" \"You don't deserve to live another second on this planet, you're just a crazy weak old man! ... This is for Caser! ... I never forgot what you did to him that day, and now I am going to do the same to you. ... \" Sil said his piece, before Hilston could even react to him appearing. ... After shoving his hand through Hilton's chest, he pulled out a still beating heart. ... \"Goodbye, 'gran... ... no... ... father'. ... \" Sil spat mockingly before he squeezed the organ in his hand, causing it to pop on the spot.******Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "Hilston might have been the strongest human, but his unprotected organ stood no chance against Sil's strength. ... In his last moment, he looked at Sil, a plethora of emotions in his eyes. ... What was strange though, was a grin had appeared as if he was expecting this moment to come at some point. ... Falling to the floor, the Blade leader lay dead in the sand. ... Sil had never imagined that the person he had been so afraid of for most of his life, the one person who had made his life a living hell, forcing him to kill his own friends would die just like that. ... Sil had always believed that one day he might be able to grow strong enough to defeat him in a fight, but for some reason this kind of ending didn't feel right. ... At the moment, he really didn't know how to feel at all. ... He had expected to feel great joy about finishing him off or maybe some sort of sadness. ... After all, for all the cruel things he had done for him, there had been rare moments of the person who had looked after them, made him call them'grandpa' had gone, but instead he just felt empty.'Is this what revenge is supposed to feel like? ... Should I have asked you a few questions after all or would it have just been worse, listening to you justify your selfish wish of growing stronger, no matter the cost?'Seeing this, Slicer, who had been fighting Hilston up to this point, started to laugh out loud. ... She couldn't believe that a human of all things was the reason for this person's death. ... Perhaps some other Dalki would have been angry, but Slicer had already gotten her use out of Hilston. ... The moment she had managed to slice off his arms, thereby managing to overwhelm the Demon tier Armour, the winner in this fight had been determined. ... Even if she would have continued to fight him, it would have been near impossible for Hilston to further aid her in her evolution anymore. ... As such, she didn't care if someone else claimed the kill. ... Not having to fight him any longer also had its upside. ... Slicer was in an incredibly weak state, yet at the same time, this made her all the more dangerous. ... Meanwhile, everyone watching at home couldn't believe this sudden interference in the fight. ... \"What the hell?! ... Why did he kill the old dude who was fighting the Dalki?! ... I always knew that they weren't on our side! ... \"\"Someone, kill them! ... The Cursed faction are traitors to humanity! ... Why would they stop us from killing a five spike Dalki? ... If the two of them teamed up they could have weakened their forces! ... \"\"The Cursed are always up to something strange. ... Up until now, I believed that the Cursed faction were the good V, but now I see it was all just for show. ... They must have been working with the Dalki all along! ... \"\"Did you already forget what happened at the start of the broadcast? ... The Blade family has come in and attacked the Cursed faction ship, remember? ... They were trying to kill them! ... \"\"So what? ... The Blade family were trying to kill the Cursed, not the human race! ... Even if they have differences, why not go for the Dalki first? ... Besides, for all we know, the Blade family were trying to get rid of the Cursed because they were working for the V! ... \"Swayed up in their emotions, everyone was filled with anger. ... They had never seen such a fight before and they were pissed off for it to come to such an unsatisfying ending. ... It was clear to them that this Dalki was far more dangerous than any other, but from what they had seen Hilston had proven to be far more powerful than any world leader, yet the actions of a single boy from the Cursed faction had not only allowed this dangerous creature to live, but had also robbed them of the one person with the best chance to defeat it. ... Inside the strange science lab, Quinn had seen it all as well. ... He was surprised, but at the same time not.'Sil, you finally got your revenge, but by the look on your face, I guess you were expecting for it to have more meaning.' Quinn thought. ... He too had experienced his fair share of getting bullied, fighting back those that had once beaten him. ... It wasn't as extreme as what Sil or the other Blade children had gone through, but he had come to the realisation that despite at one point gaining the power to punish them, that it wasn't really what he was looking forward to anymore. ... If he had gotten revenge on his bullies at that point, he would have turned out no better than them, so instead he had concentrated to improve his own situation and that of those around him. ... As a weakling Quinn had had dreams about having power, but once he got to the top it hadn't been what he had expected. ... Right now, Quinn wanted to be by his side, helping him through what was going on. ... In his mind right now, Quinn was running through the options of what exactly was the best course of action. ... What to do next. ... Standing on the sand, Vicky looked out at Sil, her head felt like it was spinning, her stomach churning. ... During this trip, she had conflicted feelings with herself, with what to do. ... In fact, for the first time since what felt like forever she and her twin brother had gotten into a serious argument. ... Before the attack, Pai had stopped her, and suggested that perhaps they should just pretend they were aiding Hilston. ... If they were to meet Sil, her brother wanted them both to let him escape. ... Of course, Vicky had disagreed with this, stating that Hilston would find out and he would make them pay dearly for crossing him. ... What they didn't expect was to meet Vorden and Raten in the bodies of humanoid beasts. ... Neither had they expected their supposed mother and father to run away, leaving them as the only ones in the real Blade family to follow Hilston's bidding.'Everything that we did... ... everything that I didâ¦ for what? ... I destroyed that Shelter, killed all those people, because I thought it would please Hilston. ... I thought it would get me on his good sideâ¦ Was it all for nothing?'Images of the faces of the people who had begged her to let them live started to appear in her mind, followed by other horrible crimes she had committed. ... The girl felt like she was about to throw up. ... That's when she felt Pai place his hand on her shoulder. ... \"You don't have to fake it anymore. ... You don't have to live a lie any longer. ... You know we're twins, right? ... I knew that everything you did was an act. ... Now we can finally be free, we can do whatever we want. ... \" Pai said, hugging his sister who began to cry. ... Tears were running down Vicky's cheek, but she wasn't really sure if she deserved to live after everything she had done. ... Looking at Sil, she could see he was still standing out there on his own. ... Perhaps he was feeling something similar to how she felt now. ... \"Wait a second. ... \" Vicky mumbled, getting out of her brother's embrace herself as she realised something horrifying. ... \"Fire, Lightning, Teleportation and Telekinesis make four abilities, so what was the fifth one? ... \"Vorden and Raten looked at each other, trying to think if they had seen Hilston use a fifth ability. ... The others didn't quite understand why it was a big deal. ... So what if he had access to one more ability? ... However, the Blade twins knew that in such a fight to the death, it was impossible for Hilston to not use everything at his disposal. ... If he had refrained from using it, then it meant he had been unable to easy it earlier. ... While sorting through all the Chained' abilities that came with a condition attached, Vicky eventually arrived at the worst possible conclusion. ... \"SIL! ... \" Vicky shouted at the top of her lungs. ... \"HILSTON'S NOT DEAD YET! ... ONE OF THE CHAINED HAD THE ABILITY OF SECOND CHANCE! ... GET RID OF HIM NOW!!!! ... \"After destroying Hilston's heart, Sil had pulled his hand out of his body and had been in his own world, his gaze aimed at the ground. ... Without his heart, Sil had been convinced that it had been the end of their tormentor. ... Just to be sure though, Sil's hands started to light up with lightning. ... Before coming here he had touched Grim, who had stayed behind, to obtain his ability. ... With no Demon tier armour, he was sure this would finish him. ... Shocking the body on the ground, the lightning had hit nothing but sand, scorching it black. ... A few meters to the side, Hilston could be seen standing, his muscular body on show without a wound on it. ... Even his hands were attached to his body, albeit new ones, the old ones still lay on the battlefield inside a part of the Demon tier beast gear. ... \"I never thought that my own flesh and blood would dare to kill me! ... I had big plans for you Sil, big plans. ... \" Hilston repeated. ... \"I told you that you will never beat me, even if your abilities are better than mine! ... \"Hilston fired out a lightning attack, yet Sil quickly countered with his own. ... However, when the two lightning bolts collided, the powers were equal. ... Despite Sil being able to access six abilities, their MC cells were just lower than the ones that Hilston had touched. ... \"I might not have the same strength as you or a body as good as yours, but it doesn't matter. ... \" Sil shouted, because it was at that moment, that blood was seen dripping from Hilston's neck and his head dropped down. ... Using his super speed Sil grabbed the head before it dropped to the ground. ... \"I don't know if you're still alive in there, but thank you for letting me kill you a second time. ... Maybe this will make me feel a little better. ... \" Sil said, as he smashed the head in the sand and stomped on it for good measure. ... The skull was smashed in seconds and the brain inside popped like a balloon. ... This was the real end of Hilston Blade.*******\n",

      "When Vicky had shouted out the ability name Second chance, Raten, Vorden and Sil had no clue what she was talking about. ... In the first place, they were the youngest members of the main Blade family, so they had yet to learn all the secrets like the others. ... The original plan had been for Sil to return after two years of military service. ... Once he had gotten 'fixed' Hilston would have proceeded with whatever his plan had been. ... However, the plan needed adjustment, since there had been no improvement in Sil and then the start of the Civil war had messed things up even further. ... However, given the name of the ability itself and the worry he had heard coming from Vicky's voice gave him enough of an idea about what the ability would be able to do. ... The user of that ability would be granted a second chance at life. ... It was an incredibly powerful ability that they had discovered, even with the drawback that it could only be used once every twenty four hours. ... The reason why not everyone in the Blade family used this ability was not only because it would limit the number of abilities they could functionally use, but also due to the high amount of MC cells it required. ... In the Blade family's case, this was a good thing. ... Alas, Hilston Blade had now been killed for a second time within this twenty four hour frame period and even without such a cooldown, Sil had made sure to destroy his brain this time. ... The headless body of the strongest human dropped to the floor, revealing Slicer. ... Just like Graham, she could be counted as an outlier amongst the Dalki, so she didn't succumb to her urges of needing to kill a human. ... Instead, she was more true to her primal desire of wanting to evolve by fighting strong opponents. ... She had been surprised to see that the person she fought for so long, had miraculously been able to revive, only for him to be killed by his killer for a second time. ... However, while her interest in Hilston had faded, with Sil demonstrating his strength, she couldn't help but want to fight him. ... For all Slicer knew, he could prove to be the final push she lacked to reach an even higher form. ... The female Dalki went ahead and swung her colossal tail, attempting to cut the newcomer down. ... Reacting, Sil hardened his body, but his defense was ineffective. ... The tail continued to go through his arm that was even able to best the Demon tier armour.'This hardening ability is supported by the MC cells of six people put together, yet it's still going through so easily!' Watching the fight, and being in the fight were two different things. ... Now Sil himself was experiencing the power of a five spike Dalki, who was on the verge of death but also her next evolution. ... \"Sil, use your lightning powers now! ... \" Vicky shouted. ... The voice was familiar, so Sil took their advice. ... However, there was nothing he could do about the arm, Slicer had claimed for her own. ... From the forearm onwards it had fallen to the ground, but with the other hand, Sil used his lightning ability. ... \"This tickles! ... \" Slicer shouted. ... \"The old man's power was the same. ... \"Running through the sand were Pai and Vicky holding hands, and they too fired off their lightning abilities, hitting Slicer again, pushing her far back and away. ... That wasn't the only attack that hit her. ... A blade made of mud attacked a wound on Slicer's left side, while another two balls of wind hit Slicer from the right. ... Raten, and Vorden had also left to join the fight. ... \"We have to help out! ... \" Fex shouted, since the rest had stayed by the sand dune. ... \"No! ... \" Sam shouted. ... \"That five spike is too strong. ... Right now, all of them have run out because of their emotional attachment, not thinking things through. ... That Dalki may be on its last legs, but it also means it's at its strongest right now. ... I won't let all of you lose your lives! ... \"It was then they could see Slicer shouting in rage, and swinging her two tail whips around, cutting the lightning attacks, while also disrupting the mud blade and wind attacks. ... \"Alright, I'll kill you all then! ... \" She shouted, but there was one more person who had yet to join in, appearing directly in front of Slicer who could see a fist in front of her face. ... \"Don't mess with my family! ... \" Borden screamed, putting all his anger and strength into this punch. ... Seeing Sil's hand on the floor infuriated him, and more so than anyone he knew the strength of the Dalki firsthand. ... When the punch landed, Slicer's face turned to the side for a second, and from the corner of her eye, she could see who, or what had just hit her. ... \"You're a Dalki, yet you dare lay your filthy hands on me! ... \" Slicer shouted, swinging her colossal tail against him, but before it hit Borden, Sil grabbed him and moved him out of the way just in time. ... Still, the sight of what had just happened had been seen by everyone who watched the livestream. ... \"That... ... was that a Dalki? ... Was it just me or did I see a Dalki go up against that five spiked one? ... Just what is going on? ... \"\"I saw it too, it had scales and spikes and everything. ... It was a four spiked Dalki! ... \"\"Why are the Dalki helping the Cursed faction?! ... See, I told you all that they really are working together! ... But why are they fighting against the five spiked Dalki? ... I'm so confused right now. ... \"\"Does it really matter what's going on? ... Maybe it's just an ability or something. ... As long as that five spike dies here, I'll support the Cursed faction. ... She has to be on her last legs and I don't care what happens but they just need to beat her! ... \"It was strange, Borden with his rising anger had managed to summon four spikes, and deliver a punch to the Slicer, but it had accomplished virtually nothing. ... It was the first time for his strength to be lacking. ... It was then that the realisation had set in, of what a mistake they all had made. ... \"Sil! ... You're fast right, we can't beat her! ... I thought maybe with all of us we could do something but we have to get out of here! ... \"Even with the rest of the Blade family present, they were all unsure if they could beat the Dalki in front of them. ... Inside the command centre, Graham, watching everything, had a concerned look on his face, but when turning to look at Quinn, it had changed to a smile. ... \"It's brilliant, right? ... This strange man of the Blade family was not something that had been within our calculations. ... He proved to be far stronger than I could have ever expected. ... Perhaps he could have even been a hope to those humans. ... Yet, isn't it ironic that another human caused him to fall in battle? ... \"\"Even in desperate times, humans are incapable of working together. ... Truly fascinating. ... If maybe all of these had helped, during the fight, Slicer would have been defeated, but now they have no one that can be a match against her. ... \" Graham stated with confidence. ... Listening and watching the whole thing, Quinn found one thing weird, the look on his face just seconds ago. ... Something had to be up.'Could it be that this female Dalki really is on her last legs?' Quinn wondered. ... \"I still don't know why you decided to betray us, but for you to not be the only one. ... It is something I will need to look into. ... And there is something that seems off about that four spiked Dalki. ... Perhaps I should ask Slicer to bring back its corpse once she is done with them. ... \" Graham walked up to the glass container staring at Quinn, he looked closer, as if he was expecting some type of reaction. ... \"The fight isn't over yet. ... They just need a little more help. ... \" Quinn said, as he closed his eyes. ... Seconds later, and a beeping sound echoed throughout the room. ... Turning to his machine Graham could see that something had happened to his 'guest'. ... A moment later and a flatline was displayed. ... 'Did he just kill himself after saying those words?' Graham wondered about the strange behaviour. ... 'No, none of us should have the ability to just kill ourselves in such a fast manner either. ... The words were also too confident and he never kept his eyes off the screen. ... ... ... It shouldn't be possible!''Slicer, she needs to get out of there NOW!'Sam was worried about Sil and the others, and he could tell that Fex wanted to run out there and help, but the two of them wouldn't be able to do a single thing against the beast. ... It was then that Sam could see Quinn in front of them all. ... Quinn was now standing opposite Slicer. ... \"Another insect has joined the battle! ... \" She growled.[Skill activated Nitro accelerate][Demon tier Amulet has finished transferring energy][Soul weapon activated Shadow Overload]\"Everyone, in another fascinating turn of events, the Cursed faction leader, Quinn Talen, has now joined the fight against the five spiked Dalki! ... \" Bonny reported.*******\n",

      "🔊 [Chapter 541] Preparing: Chapter 1239: Defeat? ... Watching the fight so far, Graham had actually been paying close attention to everything that had been going on. ... He had a keen eye, and despite only having briefly seen the faces of the people on the livestream once, he had remembered them all.'That person, they called him the Cursed faction leader. ... I was told to keep an eye on him, I never knew he was on that planet.' Graham thought. ... 'Earlier when the camera panned, he was just off by the sides, so why now of all times? ... Is it because his people are in trouble? ... No, if that was the case then he could have jumped in when the first lot did.'His mind started to go through all the possible calculations, and eventually he turned his head to the Dalki that was in his container, now having died. ... He went over to the computer to check back what had occured. ... That's when he could see that moments before the Dalki's death, its brain waves were changing, almost becoming non-existent. ... This had all happened before the Dalki had lost its life. ... \"The words spoken and the Cursed faction leader joining the fight, on top of the Dalki switching over sides, this can't all be coincidence. ... Slicerâ¦I'm afraid you might be in real trouble.'Watching the fight, through the screen, Quinn had been able to gather a few things. ... The five spiked Dalki's speed was great. ... Nearly on its last legs, it was even more powerful than anything he had encountered and there was one part of it that could move faster than any other, its tail. ... If it wasn't for Hilston having his armour, or teleportation ability he would have been caught by it a lot earlier in the fight. ... Having drained the energy from his original body a while ago, Quinn wasn't sure how strong his body would be when he returned, but he made use of the amulet's ability to allow him to drain those he had Marked. ... To his surprise, when doing so not only did he get the one spiked now two spiked Dalki energy back, but the energy he had transferred to the Dalki as well, so Quinn was not only back in top shape, but was even better. ... The only thing was, after having suffered a defeat, he knew he couldn't hold back. ... The active skill on the armour set, was to give him full speed so now he was on a timer, as such he activated his soul weapon, giving him unlimited access and full control over the shadow.'Still, this isn't enough, I lost to that five spike and I saw how much Hilston struggled to hurt it. ... I need something else.'Although, Quinn's armour was a high tier one, it was not strong enough to block any attacks coming from that tail. ... Its sharpness had already been proven by its ability to even cut through the Demon tier Armour, but there was one thing that could work. ... Shadows appeared over Quinn's hand, and now he was wielding a long Katana like blade. ... \"A sword?! ... What the hell is Quinn doing bringing out a sword in a time like this?! ... Quinn isn't a master swordsman like Leo, so why would he use that in a serious fight?! ... \" Fex complained. ... \"Maybe it isn't Quinn, and it's the other person. ... \" Sam suggested, but even if it was the real Quinn, he knew he wouldn't pull out a sword for no reason at all. ... Slicer had mostly disregarded Quinn up until now, instead focusing towards what she perceived to be the most troublesome one, the young blonde haired boy who had defeated Hilston. ... She swung her fast tail at him and Borden and Sil were unable to react to it. ... Sil had super speed, but if he was to move out of the way, Borden would likely be killed, with the rest following right after. ... Still, his hardening wasn't strong enough to block the tail, and yet a clang was heard as the tail struck against something. ... Quinn could be seen there with the sword in his hand, he had blocked the attack. ... \"Sil, I'm going to need your help, and the help of the rest of your family over there. ... Just concentrate on the strongest attack you can produce, and leave the defense to me! ... \" Quinn shouted, releasing a large wave of Qi. ... The tail was pushed back but only a little bit, and soon he was being overpowered.'So I guess that answers that question, a five spike is stronger than me, even when I use all of my Qi. ... I guess I can only rely on my shadow.' Quinn thought as a shadow was being used to block the tail. ... Of course, Slicer didn't stop there and started to move her colossal tail, attacking multiple places, yet the boosted Quinn was able to match that speed and stop it with the sword slightly, moving back using his shadow as well. ... \"How! ... How are you able to stop my attack! ... \" Slicer shouted with anger. ... With Quinn's soul weapon he didn't have a limit on how much shadow he could use, but the shadow was still slower than Slicer's primary tail. ... However, with Nitro acceleration he could match up in speed, and use the sword to block the attack. ... As for the sword itself, Quinn never thought it would be used in a situation like so, but thanks to Longblade, he had been given the sword that seemed useless but had one trait, that it was unbreakable. ... The extra speed, Qi, his vampire strength, and the energy his Demon tier Amulet had allowed him to drain, all factored into him gaining enough power to slightly push back against Slicer's tail. ... \"Everyone! ... \" Quinn shouted, continuing to block each attack with his sword. ... Although the blade could be held with one hand, he was holding it with two due to the sheer strength behind each attack. ... The tail was keeping the two of them at a distance from each other so he was unable to touch her with his gauntlets to drain her either. ... \"We might only get one chance at this, so attack with everything you got. ... We need to kill her! ... Right now, all of our planets are under attack! ... They think they can just walk over us, well I won't let them! ... \" Quinn shouted, as he held the sword with only one hand. ... His muscles bulged. ... He didn't know how much longer he could continue to block the attacks this way or at all, but he had to do something. ... Multiple shadow portals started to appear around the area where Slicer was at. ... At the same time, without her knowledge, consumed by the rage of not being able to defeat the opponent in front of her, a shadow was covering the sand and had now reached underneath her feet as well.'It looks like Hilston did a number on your wings and I have to thank him for that!'Now with the shadow portals open, Quinn ran back out of range of the tail. ... He placed the sword away, and started to run forward. ... He didn't have much time, as the active skill was running out, but now he had to rely on his body to avoid all of the tail strikes. ... Moving left, right, piles of sand were chucked up and that's when Slicer noticed something.'My attacks, they have slowed down!'It was the effect of the shadow path she was standing on that had covered the wide area in shadow. ... With this, Quinn could avoid the attacks more easily under the effects of his boost. ... He soon threw his red blood disks out into two of the shadow portals by his side, while running forward, and they all started to appear from the shadows that were scattered around Slicer.'Kill, I have to kill the Dalki! ... I have to get stronger, to beat him!' Was running through Quinn's head, and a mist started to appear from his back.'I shall help you with your desire.' The voice said, as another portal appeared from behind. ... It was the Boneclaw which was as large as the Dalki itself. ... With its giant claws, it had pierced Slicer back. ... The almost impenetrable skin had been penetrated with ease. ... She screamed out in pain and swung her colossal tail, hoping to cut the Boneclaw, once hit it had turned back into the black mist and disappeared once more, but the familiar had already done a number on her. ... It also gave Quinn enough time to sprint forward, and with his two blood drills he was ready. ... Now, standing behind the five spiked Dalki, Borden, Raten and Vorden were ready to follow up the Boneclaw's attack. ... Quinn thrusted both blood drills directly into the five spiked Dalki's chest. ... The blood continued to spin in place, attempting to pierce the skin, but it seemed impossible. ... However, Slicer soon felt another force, pushing her from behind. ... Borden, Raten and Sil used their strength at the same time, hitting the Dalki from all sides, to prevent her from flying away. ... Still, they were unable to peirce the body, but the Qi had done a lot of internal damage. ... Moving out of the way, Quinn's nitro accelerate time was up. ... \"It's up to you. ... \" Quinn said, keeping his shadow ready just in case. ... It was an emergency measure, so that Quinn would be able to temporarily put Slicer in the Shadow lock, and keep her there hopefully long enough for everyone else to escape. ... When Quinn moved though, it was to allow one last attack to go through. ... A lightning attack that was being made, by now the combination of the strongest ability users in existence. ... Sil, Pai and Vicky, had jumped up, and started to spin their bodies as the three of them had turned their bodies into gigantic lightning bolts. ... Due to the three of them being together, they were able to create one giant lightning bolt strike. ... Slicer was far more injured than she had perceived as she had never felt this way before.'I have toâ¦get away.' It was the first time her instincts told her to flee instead of continuing a fight. ... Alas, she could see nothing but a bright light in front of her. ... Skimming her hand over her chest, she felt that her scales had been damaged a little.'That black haired personâ¦is dangerous' Was her last thought, as she was struck by the lightning bolt that had passed right through her. ... Sil, Pai, and Vicky were seen on the other side. ... Looking back only to see half of Slicer's body completely missing. ... \"They did it, they did it! ... They defeated the five spiked Dalki! ... \" Bonny announced it to the whole world. ... At the same time, Quinn heard a familiar ding sound.******\n",

      "For the viewers watching through the livestream, when they had seen Hilston Blade defeated, they had been sure that this was the end. ... Someone of such great power they had never known even existed a couple hours ago, they had lost him as quickly as they had found out about him. ... He had powers that surpassed the former Big Four and he had been able to use their powers one after another to a stronger degree. ... If even someone like him could not defeat the five Spike, then the world couldn't imagine who else could. ... Their anger and frustration had been directed towards the one that had caused his death, who was none other than Sil, another Blade that belonged to the Cursed faction. ... Soon, they thought that his death and the rest of their deaths would quickly come after, something most felt deserving for having gotten involved. ... They also looked to be losing out against the five Spike, but all of that changed with the arrival of the Cursed faction leader. ... \"Why is the reporter getting so excited to see Quinn arrive? ... Does she really think that he is going to be able to do anything? ... \"\"I don't know and I don't care. ... There goes my diet, since we're all going to die anyway, might as well enjoy the rest of my life eating everything I have avoided so far. ... \"\"Weren't there rumours about them having a fling? ... Of course, she needs to hype up her boyfriend. ... \"\"But isn't he the one who defeated all those Dalki back then? ... Maybe he can do something again. ... I don't want to die. ... The Dalki has to be nearly dead! ... They just have to give it one more push! ... \"Most of them didn't believe one person could change anything, yet the flow of the entire fight had changed. ... ââBonny had instructed Void to make sure to capture the intense look off Quinn's eyes as they glowed red, and the cameraman also managed to show off the point when the Cursed faction leader's soul weapon was activated. ... Shadows had risen all around everywhere, and using the strange sword, the Vampire Lord had managed to block the tail attack. ... In the end, although Sil and the others were the ones that had finished off the Dalki with the last attack, it was clear as day to everyone that none of it could have been achieved without the last one to arrive.ââPeople were jumping for joy around all the different planets as they saw humanity defeat the great Dalki. ... A five spiked Dalki had never been seen before, apart from One Horn, so they were sure they had delivered a huge blow to their forces.ââ\"Quinn, you and your group, you actually managed to defeat a five spike. ... You really will become our hope. ... \" Sach thought. ... Samantha, who was by his side, was shaking instead. ... When they had gone against One Horn, they hadn't even been able to draw out his full strength, judging by the video they had just watched. ... 'Howâ¦ how am I meant to defeat someone like One Horn if this is how strong they can get?' She thought. ... Worst yet, how was anyone able to defeat a five spike now. ... Did they have to rely on the Cursed faction? ... Even within the Dalki, one spike's strength could differ by quite a bit, so she wondered if it was the same for the five spikes. ... There was no telling what would happen if they were to meet another one, and this time there would be no Hilston Blade to weaken it first.âââ\"Haha, Quinn you did it! ... Did you see that everyone? ... He used my blade to do it! ... \" Longblade cheered for joy as he watched the fight with his subordinates. ... \"That means that I played a major part in taking that thing down. ... It was because of me that he was able to defeat the Dalki! ... \"\"Yes sir, it was smart of you to give him that blade, knowing he would be able to use it ahead of time. ... \" Avion complimented his superior, clearly knowing that that hadn't been Longblade's intention at all. ... Still it couldn't hurt to entertain him. ... \"I hope we get to meet them again. ... \" Rafer added.âââBack on the Cursed planet themselves, they were more joyous than before, those that were on the fence about Quinn, since he had revealed he was a V had almost forgotten all about that. ... They were proud to have a leader like that and such a strong team.'Quinn, thank God you survived. ... I guess I need to do my part as well to enjoy that future.' Helen mused.âââOf course, even the Dalki had received the news, and Graham who had been paying attention to the whole thing in particular, seemed to be enraged. ... \"Damn it, to think we would lose Slicer this early on! ... \" Graham cursed, and swung his arm, smashing the glass container by his side. ... The liquid flowed out onto the floor and the Dalki body with it. ... Soon, Graham was seen making a call to a certain someone. ... When the call was answered, Graham didn't hold back. ... \"I thought the idea of teaming up with that vampire was that the other vampires wouldn't get involved! ... That damn Cursed faction leader is a vampire, isn't he? ... So why did he act against us?! ... \" Graham demanded to know an answer. ... \"Graham, I would suggest you take a deep breath. ... Anger doesn't suit you. ... Our plan is proceeding even better than we had estimated, despite things that we didn't foresee. ... In the first place, that boy has always been a special case. ... I just never expected him to cause this many problems for us in such a short time. ... Tell me your honest opinion, do you regard him as a problem you need my help with? ... Or is he someone you can deal with on your own? ... \" The person asked. ... Seeing Quinn fight, and the others, Graham, was trying to put himself in the same place as Slicer. ... \"I don't need your help, not that you alone would be much of a help anyway. ... \" Graham grumbled. ... \"Howeverâ¦ I will have to adjust my plans without Slicer. ... Don't you complain about me taking a more 'liberal' approach from now on. ... \" Graham ended the call there, going through the footage once more, in hopes to spot whatever he could. ... He rewinded the video a few times, and played it forward watching it again and again. ... 'I'm sure of it. ... One of those that were watching the fight on the sand dune and the Dalki that got involved in the fight, that four spike are the same person. ... They look almost human-like when they are on the Sand Dune. ... Yet, when fighting and showing the spiked the Dalki features appear more so. ... Something is going on. ... Perhaps I have found myself a new research subject. ... Maybe I can make him replace Slicer?''But first, I really need to calm myself down a little...'Graham walked to the Dalki body on the floor, still thinking that perhaps the Dalki and Quinn were linked in some way, and lifted it off the ground. ... \"You might have won this battle, but I promise you I will make you pay the price for it. ... \" Graham spoke, before crushing the lifeless Dalki's head.âââDeactivating his soul weapon, the after effects of using it were now being shown, making him lose some of his MC points. ... They were currently at 1100. ... He hadn't used it for long, so the points lost weren't too major. ... The others were now running towards Quinn to see if he was okay, while Sil was picking up his arm as well. ... When they walked past Hilston, some of them decided to side step or take the long way around his body, and it was the same for Slicer's corpse as well. ... \"Quinn, are you alright? ... It's you inside your body, right? ... \" Fex asked his best friend to make sure. ... \"Yeah, it's me. ... \" Quinn answered, not fully knowing what had happened while he had been away. ... More so, the Cursed faction leader was interested in something else. ... Since he wasn't in his body when he had met Slicer, Quinn was unaware that he had received a Quest. ... However, he wasn't the one that killed Slicer, so he didn't seem to get any exp, and since the Blades weren't a part of his Cursed faction family the exp from the kill wasn't shared either. ... Nevertheless, he did come out with a reward. ... 'After all that trouble, I had to have gotten something.' Quinn thought. ... Before looking at it, the Vampire Lord was reflecting on the fight. ... He was wondering if they would have been able to defeat the other five spikes that he had met. ... Hilston had done a lot of damage to the Dalki beforehand. ... Although the Dalki was stronger due to the damage, some of the injuries Hilston had done to the Dalki were beyond regular healing. ... On top of that, the female Dalki had displayed great vitality to the point she had been able to regenerate an even strengthened tail. ... Still, he estimated that the majority of the damage had been Hilston's achievements, with the next highest amount being Slicer's choice of hurting herself. ... The main problem when facing the five Spike, was how tough its skin was, and how hard it was to even do a little bit of damage. ... Hilston with his demon tier armour's active skill had time to charge up a strong enough attack, but Quinn was unable to do the same, even with his Shadow overload skill since it didn't really increase his attack power. ... He had the speed and he might have had the defence, but he lacked the power to go against his enemies like Hilston. ... Which was why Quinn hadn't insisted on being the one to deal out the last blow, leaving that to Sil.'If it was a fight from the beginning, we all would have died even with my soul weapon, and we know the Dalki have at least two other five spikes. ... Worst of all, that weird Dalki is creating a method to evolve the spikes on their backs.' It was bad news, and unless Quinn could reach the next stage, he saw no way of them winning the war. ... Checking his rewards, Quinn was hoping for something good, now he needed the system to deliver more than ever, but what he didn't realise, was as soon as Slicer had been defeated, the fighting had resumed with even more frenzy on the Dalki side.[Quest failed][12/10 Cursed planets have been taken over.]*******Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "Three men were seen walking through a busy street. ... There were market stalls set up selling trinkets, food, ability books and more. ... Crystals were placed in lamps giving off a nice orange glow on the items and pathway, and the reflection of red could be seen in the people's eyes. ... Currently, the group of three men who worked under Paul were on this very street. ... They didn't just work for Paul as a Vampire knight, but previously when he was the head general as well. ... The place they were in at the moment was the pool area, away from the tenth castle inner area. ... For them, it was a place they didn't venture into often. ... The tenth family mostly sent on separate hunts on the planet itself, hunting for crystals. ... Either through the forest and the vast land or through some of the portals the tenth family owned. ... It was interesting to find out that the vampires knew of planets that existed out of those in Earth's solar system and the beast's planets solar system. ... Due to their high-tech, they also didn't need so many different portals linked to each planet and instead could input codes that would take them to such worlds. ... The vampires were just as interested in using beast crystals as humans, but it was more so to advance their technology and power their equipment, rather than for the use of beast equipment in a war. ... Still, the pool area was avoided in the tenth family because of the disconnect it currently had with the other families. ... After Quinn had defeated the second leader and stopped the rebellion from Cindy, he had been hailed a hero. ... There were many that had requested to join, but most of them had been turned away. ... Quinn wanted to treat those that were loyal to the tenth family, who were with them despite the mistreatment and being considered weak. ... Some vampires thought that if they were to join the tenth family, it would be an easy promotion to the inner circle. ... Since they had failed to be promoted in their own circles for so long. ... After realising this wouldn't work, they bore a grudge. ... At the same time, the general public didn't like the fact that the tenth area was more reinforced than the rest of the castles. ... The walls were better, and there were those strange towers that packed quite the punch. ... It was something the other families just didn't have, causing them to feel jealous. ... These were the reasons why the tenth family, if they could avoid it, decided to stay out of the pooling area. ... The three that were there today, one of them had been appointed as captain of the vampire group under Paul called Ashley. ... He was one of the first ones to be turned, and the two with him were Ben and Ghost. ... While travelling, they were carefully looking around the area, sticking close together. ... \"I thought it was a good idea to take off our armour. ... That makes us stick out like a sore thumb, but it looks like the others are still looking at us. ... \" Ben commented while not backing down as he locked eyes with another family member. ... The armour he was talking about was the special set that would be rewarded to those in the tenth family. ... The system that had initially been implemented by Timmy. ... Now that the tenth family was back up and running again, Timmy had decided to start up again, but it stood out since the armour was quite distinctive. ... \"You have to remember, there aren't a lot of vampires here in the first place. ... They probably see the same faces every day and have done so for years. ... Just remember why we are here. ... \" Ashley said, looking down. ... He held a tablet with a list of names, and some of the names had green circles by the side. ... Eventually, they had taken a turn down an alleyway, away from the main busy street. ... Now they were in a block of strange-looking houses. ... In the pooling area, the vampires lived stacking on top of each other like apartments, but three stories was the limit. ... So they didn't have huge tall skyscrapers like human cities. ... Taking the stairs at the side of the building, they climbed up to the top floor and gave a few knocks. ... \"Careful, you remember the last one came out attacking us on the spot. ... \" Ghost said. ... After a few knocks, it seemed like there was no answer. ... \"Victormen Ten, are you there! ... \" Ashley shouted and gave a few more knocks. ... After no such answer, Ashley gave the nod towards ben. ... With a firm push, the door snapped open. ... It was only a wooden door after all. ... In the pooling area, they never exactly expected to have intruders. ... Perhaps there would be arguments from other vampires, but they allowed for vampires to mostly deal with that themselves. ... If a vampire died fighting, well that vampire just wasn't strong enough and shouldn't have started a fight in the first place. ... The three of them searched the room carefully to see if there were signs of anything. ... The room was quite small. ... It was similar to a studio apartment, with a bed tv, and the kitchen area all in one place, only the bathroom was separate. ... It was then that they spotted that a corner of the table was snapped. ... It perhaps wasn't a big deal, but it seemed strange since it had broken off and there were a few splinters on the ground. ... It should have been cleaned by now. ... \"Are you sure you told him to stay in his house around this time? ... \" Ashely asked. ... \"Of course, I know how important this is. ... I'm not going to make that type of mistake. ... \" Ghost replied. ... Ben then let out a sigh. ... \"I can't believe it. ... The vampires are having people taken away from them, and they don't even notice it. ... I mean, I know we wouldn't have noticed if we weren't doing this as well, but with so few people, you think they would keep better track. ... \"\"Apparently, it's because the vampires live in the polling area. ... If their lives are lost, other vampires just see this as an opportunity to have children. ... To try and create stronger vampires for the future. ... With the cap of vampires per family and their long lifespan, it would take a long time before they were allowed any children. ... I guess their solution is to not really care about the lives of those in the pooling area. ... \" Ashley updated the tablet, and now there was a big X by one of their names. ... It wasn't the only name with an X either, as Ashley went back a few days searching through the names. ... People who were from the tenth family and in the polling area were going missing. ... There were no signs of confrontation. ... No sign of criminal activity either. ... They would just vanish, and later it would be reported as a death. ... Of course, the one who had ordered this investigation was none other than Paul. ... He had been advised by Kazz to not look into things, but he felt like if they were to look the other way, or not find out who was the one behind it all, then there was a good chance that the situation would just get worse. ... Soon they would think they could step other all of the tenth family. ... \"Well, we know that they are taking people from the tenth area, that's for sure. ... The question is, we don't know where they went. ... Judging by the table, I think this one might have been quite recent. ... We could ask the people who live in the area, but we all know how that has gone so far. ... \" Ashley suggested. ... Ghost grabbed his arm, a wound that had long healed, but they knew how much hostility there was towards the tenth family. ... It was strange because they had believed the situation had gotten better, but it was almost as if somehow it had gotten worse. ... Before any of the others, Ashley heard footsteps coming from outside. ... The sound of the vampires in the street could be heard from all of them, so it wasn't too out of the ordinary, but Ashley could tell that the footsteps were constant and coming at a fast rate. ... \"Someone's coming! ... \" Ashley shouted, and soon all three of them drew their weapons. ... Ashley a standard sword, while Ben and Ghost had pulled something that resembled a pitchfork, but they were far more deadly than pitchforks. ... Soon a blur could be seen entering the room, and Ashley struck in its place. ... He couldn't quite see the figure or who it was but just had to guess. ... However, his sword managed to amount to nothing as it was being gripped tightly. ... \"A weapon made from the blood fairy, I guess the tenth family still hasn't gotten rid of these. ... Although you do have privileges, the others don't. ... For finding such a weapon on a family member, the verdict would usually be death, all apart from the tenth family that is. ... \" The voice said. ... Now that the target was no longer moving, Ashley could see who it was that he had struck at. ... He wore a full set of black armour, his upper body gigantic and wide and on his head a black specially designed Helmet covering his face. ... \"Muka, the ninth leader... ... \" Ashley said in disbelief. ... \"It looks like the tenth family has already caught on to something strange happening in the settlement. ... I thought without Quinn, Edward and that Blind swordsman that you would have been slow on the uptake. ... Or too afraid to act, I guess the tenth family are a little different. ... Let me be straight with you, tell your Vampire knight that I want to help with his little investigation. ... \" Muka explained.*******\n",

      "Although Ashley hadn't been in the vampire settlement for long, there was one thing that had been rammed in their heads, by Xander, Timmy and Amy. ... The fact that if a vampire leader requested something, they were to comply. ... Of course, there were certain things they could decline, especially if it was something that would cause a conflict with another family. ... Still, in any case, it was always better to act first and then later to report what had happened. ... Because of this, Ashley was in a position where he had to do what was asked and had called Paul ahead of time. ... He felt a little down since if he was more alert or cautious, they could have perhaps escaped or left the place before anyone had seen them. ... Still, Paul had agreed to the meeting, and now, both Muka and Paul were in the tenth castle together. ... Sat opposite each other in his personal office. ... \"Do you ever take that helmet off? ... In the human world, it would be considered quite rude that I don't get to see your face. ... \" Paul asked. ... Muka still was covered in the armour that he always wore, and this included his helmet. ... The truth was, there weren't many that had ever seen Muka take off the helmet, and there were those who were too afraid to ask as well. ... \"Is everyone in the tenth family as rude as this. ... I suppose in military terms, I would have a higher rank than you. ... You know, in the past, I had joined a few wars myself, although we didn't use guns and such. ... So I have experience being in armies. ... Let's say even if I don't belong to your squad. ... I don't suppose you would ask a superior why they were to keep on such a thing, would you? ... \" Muka asked. ... Paul thought about it for a while. ... He knew what he was doing. ... He knew that to ask about such a thing could be considered offensive, but if someone really wanted to work with them, they would have to take this offence in their stride. ... If they didn't, they would use this offence as an excuse to attack. ... Muka had done neither but just was trying to reeducate Paul in a way. ... \"I would,\" Paul answered. ... \"If the two of us were close, I would feel comfortable asking about these things. ... Sometimes some relationships are beyond rank, and I suppose what you might be asking me to do would go beyond rank, would it not? ... \" Paul replied. ... After hearing where Muka had arrived at and catching Ashley and the others. ... Paul could only assume that the two of them were looking into the same thing. ... The question was, had both of them arrived at the same conclusion about who was just behind all of this. ... \"Your family isn't the only one that has had people go missing. ... So far, every single family has been affected. ... \" Muka stated, ignoring the comments from earlier. ... \"I don't think any of the other leaders have others to look into this, or at worst, it seems some have chosen to ignore this. ... This is why I'm finding it difficult to pinpoint who is exactly behind this. ... Right now, my only cleared suspect is the tenth family. ... \"\"And why haven't you suspected that Bryce is behind this? ... \" Paul said straight after. ... \"I have been by Quinn's side for a while now, and I have been watching all of the leader's actions. ... Whenever there was a chance, you would be sure to suspect Bryce. ... Honestly, I thought today you would do the same, so why not him? ... \"Paul hadn't found any leads, leading this back to Bryce. ... It was strange because his disappearance would sometimes lead them to other families, not just the first family. ... However, because of the way Kazz had acted, he had a suspicion it had something to do with the first family and who else but the king of vampires to have connections to all of the families. ... Or even be brave enough to do such a thing. ... \"Because I was wrong in the past, and this time I need to be careful. ... I have always been trying to do things myself, and I know someone was behind the death of my own knights. ... However, I can't go around calming things, especially now. ... \" Muka replied. ... By saying these words, Paul knew it was because now Bryce was in a higher position than he was before. ... As a leader, accusations could be made from others due to being the same rank, but an allegation about the king, in times like these. ... They would think Muka was trying to stir something up again. ... \"Very well, then let me put a hypothetical question in front of you. ... Say if the king was to commit a crime as grave as this, is there a way to dethrone him? ... Or perhaps punish even the king for such crimes? ... \" Paul asked. ... \"There is, or perhaps I should say there was,\" Muka replied. ... \"The council has the power to vote in the king. ... Rightly so, the leaders also have the right to dethrone him as well. ... However, evidence must first be provided why he is unfit, and then there would be a vote. ... If a king was voted in, it would be very hard to convince those who voted for him to overturn their vote. ... There is also fear that with the king's power, they could force votes from the other leaders. ... \"The second problem is starting a trial in the first place. ... Usually, in the past, the evidence would be provided to the fourteenth family. ... The punishers, a power equal to the king. ... This allowed the leaders to vote freely, as they knew the punisher would be able to force the king to the council's bidding. ... As you know, they are no longer with us. ... Without the Punishers, the king in these times have greater power. ... \"Lastly, even if a vote to dethrone the king was to happen, there would need to be a candidate that was fit for this purpose, and honestly, I don't think there is anyone that the other leaders can be behind. ... I worry for us. ... \"You may have noticed that the tenth family's mistreatment has started again, but it is not just your family. ... It is the other families as well. ... With Bryce coming into power, the divide between the vampire sides has only grown. ... Those who think we should leave this place come out of hiding and rule over the humans. ... And those who believe we should be their protectors. ... \"Still, we can use this to our advantage and gather vampires that could vote to throw Bryce out, but first, we need evidence,\" Muka explained. ... \"And what about someone who could deal with Bryce if he didn't agree? ... \" Paul asked. ... For this, Muka had no answers. ... In the third castle was the third vampire leader Suzan. ... She was currently in her room that was filled with dolls upon dolls of all sizes. ... They weren't just human dolls but teddy bears, different animals and more. ... Right now, she was using her special needles to sow outfits for them all. ... In particular, it was a large one she was working on today. ... However, her hands were a bit unsteady. ... She had pricked her fingers a few times, again and again. ... \"What is Bryce thinking? ... \" She thought, with her knees trembling as she continued to sow. ... \"He told us he had a plan but then doesn't inform us of what is going on. ... Why do I always decide to listen and follow him? ... I followed him back then, I followed him with the vote and nowâ¦ it's too late. ... \"She suddenly pricked her finger again, this time deeper. ... She had stopped for a few seconds waiting for the wound to heal and then was ready to start again. ... It was the only way she could get the worry out of her head, but when she tried to move her hand, it was suddenly grabbed. ... \"You're right, it is too late, and now it is time for you to be punished for your crimes. ... \" A dark voice said. ... When Suzan looked around her, she soon noticed that all the walls were covered in pitch black. ... Shadows were everywhere, and no matter how loud she would scream, no one could hear it. ... Her, a vampire leader, one of the strongest vampires, was shivering in fear because she knew there was no hope.******\n",

      "The forest with the dark purple leaves could sometimes seem endless, with the terrain changing very little for Erin and Leo. ... Mountains, small rivers, lakes, ponds, and of course, trees, plenty, plenty of trees. ... Although the two of them wished to stay near the vampire settlement, Erin's senses improved by the day. ... Each time, they were able to head out further from the settlement, and Erin could still sense the general direction of where the vampires were. ... This was something unique to her as a dhampir. ... At the same time, it seemed like she was controlling her powers better, but control wasn't the only thing she was getting good at. ... They had ventured further out because the vampires in the area now seemed non-existent. ... What surprised them as they did this was that even as they further explored the planet, there would always be a stray out there somewhere. ... Some of them were minding their own matters, just wishing to live a life away from the settlement. ... They chose to leave them alone while others were running away from crimes they had committed. ... The second they saw Leo and Erin, they thought they were from the settlement and had come to chase them down. ... Still, Leo didn't kill them instantly, or at least he didn't make it so Erin would because he wanted to find out more about them. ... Find out their reason for leaving. ... With his influence skill as a vampire knight, there weren't many that could resist his control. ... The rivers had become a frequent place for the two of them to stop at. ... For some reason, the sound of the water running down was calming for both of them. ... Sitting on top of a stone, Leo was observing, more so with his ears. ... With the sound of the river, chains could be heard and then shortly after, the sound of the wind being cut. ... This repeated several times with certain gaps of sound in between. ... As if someone was going through specific steps. ... Each time this was repeated, not a single time did the pattern not repeat in the exact matter. ... It was perfect, again and again until finally, the pattern was off.'The timing, it was off.'\"Stop! ... \" Leo shouted. ... Instantly, chains fell to the floor, and huffing and panting from Erin could be heard. ... \"You have done remarkably well. ... When we came here, I only wanted to help you control the energy inside you, but it looks like you have been able to achieve more than that. ... \" Leo complimented her. ... \"Creating your own swordsmanship, one that incorporates the suppression chains, is no easy matter. ... You have done well creating these 6 different movements. ... \"You have nearly perfected them. ... However, there is one thing that we can't fix,\" Leo said, looking at his own blade. ... When fighting the four spiked Dalki, he saw how effective agent 1's weapons were against it. ... Leo's weapon wasn't weak, but it was granted a boost in power due to the curse it had on it. ... This only helped when fighting against the Dalki, but even against a four spike, the boost wasn't enough. ... \"I have the Demi-god tier crystal that had been given to me by that man we met. ... I would like you-\"\"No. ... \" Erin interrupted Leo. ... \"Leo, you have your own goal, and to do that, you need stronger weapons as well. ... We know that Pure's leader is most likely your old master from what you have told me. ... \"I'm sure you have heard the rumours as well as I have. ... That Pure has a Demon tier weapon in their possession. ... I know your skills are great Leo, I know you are strong. ... Unfortunately, I think this just is something skill can't overcome. ... Besides, I haven't finished the move set yet. ... I plan for there to be 12 movements altogether. ... \"Leo was taken aback by this. ... Erin's progression had been extraordinary. ... Her strength had grown fast, to the point where now it was nearly at his own. ... However, there were a few things Leo still had an advantage of Erin in. ... His control of Qi was more fine-tuned, while at the same time, he had experience. ... His fighting sense and tactics were above hers, but Erin was young, and this could be improved. ... When she had told Leo she was going to create her own swordsmanship style, he was impressed, and when she actually achieved it, he didn't think he could be surprised again, yet here they were. ... \"From the vampires, the Bloodsuckers we have killed so far, we have gathered all different types of Blood crystals. ... Learning how to use the Katana-style sword with the suppression chains will be the first six moves, and I plan to have a weapon created from their blood crystals. ... \"I can finally help the others in the Cursed faction. ... When I first was sent to Pure, I hated it, I thought why me, but slowly I realised that Quinn, Layla. ... All of them saved my life from Truedream, and then they saved me again. ... It's time to return the favour. ... \"However, I don't want to forget my past either. ... The longsword I used to use, and the swordsmanship that was taught to me by my parents. ... I wish to improve it, and I plan to create another set of six movements for that weapon. ... That will be my beast weapon. ... \"Hearing this, Leo thought it represented Erin quite well, to have one best weapon that the humans used and one blood weapon that the vampires used. ... The only thing was they didn't have the current weapons. ... For her, Longsword had broken. ... \"I think it's time we head back to the Cursed faction then. ... We can obtain the crystals needed for this and ask Alex to forge us both new weapons for our journey. ... It's been a long time. ... \" Leo smiled. ... Heading back through the forest, they realised they were quite far out, and even with their speed, it would take around half a day to return, but before they could even move from the river, they sensed two large objects coming their way. ... Crashing in front of the two stones were chucked into the river, and small waves were made pushing it over the edge. ... A great wind force had hit both of them.'What happened? ... If they were vampires, I should have sensed them from a mile away.' Erin thought. ... Leo had quickly drawn his sword. ... Now they were in front of them, he knew what they were. ... \"They are in a place like this! ... \"\"Who would have thought that we would see two stray vampires all the way out here at a place like this. ... \" One of the attackers said. ... \"I bet they were surprised to see our return but too bad you won't be telling anyone anything. ... \" The other said. ... The two that had appeared in front of them were Dalki. ... The Dalki had arrived on the vampire planet, but what were they doing so out of the settlement. ... When both Erin and Leo had seen the number of spikes on the back, they weren't worried at all, for there was only one. ... \"I've been waiting, waiting for a while to do this! ... \" Erin said as she went in for the attack. ... It was safe to say that neither of the Dalki's had lasted very long, and both of their heads were seen rolling on the floor. ... After dealing with the Dalki, they both continued to head to the vampire settlement. ... It was safe to say they didn't have a clue why the Dalki were there, but they had decided to head back towards the settlement to see if something was up. ... They could have tried to find where the Dalki had come from, but so far out, they thought it was a risk. ... At the same time, Leo wanted to know more before doing anything. ... This perhaps would be a matter where they would need to contact Quinn as well. ... When they finally were coming close to the settlement, the two wore their cloaks covering up their faces and heads. ... There were guards stationed outside the settlement and even in the forest area, which they hadn't seen before. ... Regardless, for Erin and Leo, it was easy to bypass them without being seen, using the terrain of the trees and more.'Could it be that the Dalki really have attacked the settlement as well?' Leo thought. ... However, when they entered the settlement, there was a strange feeling coming from the people. ... They could hear whispering and moans from everyone. ... \"What do we do! ... What do we do! ... \"\"This has never happened before, and they managed to get inside! ... \"\"Who could be strong enough to even do such a thing! ... \"The people were in a panic. ... \"Is it what we saw before? ... \" Erin asked Leo, not wanting to say the name of the creatures in case someone had overheard them. ... \"No, this seems to be something different. ... The people look to be moving towards a certain place, and there are no signs of an attack. ... Let's follow them and see. ... \" Leo replied. ... Following the crowds of people, they could see that some of the vampires had tears in their eyes. ... Others were shaking as they moved back. ... \"Everyone stand back, from the third castle! ... Get away from the third castle. ... This is an order! ... \" A group of vampires shouted. ... Seeing who they were, one could see that they were the Royal guard. ... A group of fifty or so vampires that worked directly under the king. ... They had the same power as a vampire knight. ... Currently, Ten of them were marching through, heading towards the third castle. ... When Leo and Erin finally went there, they could see what everyone was looking at. ... From the pooling area, just outside the third castle inner area, one could see the whole castle in view. ... At the very top, the leader Suzan Toppy had been pinned using stakes to the wall. ... Her blood dripped on the castle walls, and there was no sign of life from her. ... It was very clear that the third leader had been killed, and someone wanted to make sure that everyone knew about it.*******\n",

      "A moment of peace was achieved, but that was all it was, a moment. ... The human race was able to celebrate the victory they had achieved over the five spike. ... The fighting around the beast solar system had stopped as everyone's eyes were glued to the screen, and in the end, they had obtained a victory. ... However, it was as if the Dalki, now we're fighting Vengeance, having witnessed one of their leaders killed. ... The attacks on the planets on each of the Human groups' sections was now in full force. ... The mother ships had dropped the Dalki, allowing them to build fortresses. ... Once finished, the ships moved to the next planet for support. ... Those that had been taken over, a token group of Dalki were left behind as the others joined forces with the struggling planets. ... Eventually, overwhelming the human race on each of the Shelters. ... It hadn't even taken an entire day. ... All of this was done within a few hours after Slicer's defeat. ... In the end, each of the groups, including the Cursed faction, had decided to concentrate their forces even more so. ... The Earthborn group, the Graylash group and the Cursed faction were just down to controlling three planets each. ... In order for the Dalki to keep control of each of the planets, their forces were thinned out more and more, until eventually, the Dalki themselves knew that if they were to attack, it would be a struggle. ... It was a shame because even the planets that Quinn had destroyed motherships on, eventually were forced to retreat as neighbouring forces came over. ... The problem was, with so few planets, the pushing issue of Crystals was becoming more apparent. ... There were just too few resources to go around to keep up the fight, and if the human race didn't do something soon, they would slowly meet their end. ... The Cursed faction was in a bit better state and situation compared to the others. ... This was thanks to Quinn. ... After destroying the Motherships on said planets, Quinn informed the faction leader that the ships contained many Crystals on board. ... Since Quinn was in his Dalki form when defeating these motherships, he could not store the crystals in his system. ... Fortunately, all of the factions were able to obtain the crystals inside. ... Which meant the Cursed faction didn't have a short supply like the other factions. ... Still, even for them, time would eventually run out. ... Back on planet Caladi, the planet filled with sand, the Cursed faction had yet to leave the place. ... The Shelter had been quickly rebuilt, but certain parts were needed for the Bertha ship to be fully up and running again. ... The good news was, with the Blade family working together, they were able to use their strong telekinesis powers to move the whole ship to the back of the Shelter, away from where they had crashed landed. ... With their help, they could fix the ship even quicker. ... At the moment, the Cursed faction would use this planet as their base, but they weren't alone. ... Out of the three planets that were considered safe for the Earthborn faction, planet Caladi was one of them. ... After Slicer had been defeated, the mothership that was overlooking them had left. ... They later found out it was to join another planet. ... Still, there were currently no Dalki ships present at all on planet Caladi. ... Even on the other two Earthborn planets, there were still Dalki motherships and fortresses, so it made it one of the safest places for people to be, that included for civilians. ... With the help of Sam, the Shelter was going through an extension. ... Earth ability users were put to use, and once again, the Blade family. ... They were able to do what a small group of earth users would be required for. ... Due to all the problems, it led to a world meeting, as they needed to strategise what their plan of action was next. ... Of course, both Owen and Helen were unable to leave their bases, so they would be joining the meeting virtually. ... However, the Cursed group were waiting on Sach to arrive at the planet, as he had left Samantha in charge, who seemed to have her head screwed back on again. ... As well as this, Sam had called all the main Cursed leaders, apart from Helen, to arrive at Planet Caladi as well. ... This included the likes of Alex, Wevil and Linda. ... At the moment, Quinn was resting in the military base that was located on the Shelter. ... Standing outside were many guards and people cheering outside. ... After what they had seen and everything that happened, they wanted to thank Quinn. ... The others in the Cursed faction were also experiencing praise and gifts from strangers. ... It was nice for the public to have a good opinion of them for a change. ... For Quinn himself, he had told everyone to leave him be, for now, and he would be ready by the time Sach and the others arrived. ... Quinn was sitting in a comfy office chair, swirling around spinning, looking at the metallic plain room. ... It felt strange that the person who had last used this thing was dead, but his mind was being filled with all sorts of odd thoughts like that because he was still at a loss for what to do after defeating Slicer. ... Opening up his system, he could see a countdown timer that told him he had 12 hours remaining and was counting down the seconds. ... First, Quinn had looked at the quest rewards for beating Slicer. ... Apparently, at the time, Vincent had received two clearance options for the quest. ... One of them was to survive. ... Usually, Quinn would get this type of quest if the system didn't think he would live. ... However, Quinn had proved the system wrong once before and received great rewards because of it. ... This time, the system had also given Quinn a second way to clear the request, which was to defeat Slicer. ... The problem was because Quinn wasn't the one that had dealt the finishing blow, and due to Sil and the Balde family not being part of Quinn's cursed family, he didn't receive any exp from the Slicer death, nor meet the requirements to clear the quest. ... Alas, he did meet the requirements to complete the survival quest, which had given him an extra level, which 'would' have brought him up to level 70. ... The level where Quinn had suspected there was another evolution. ... Regardless, the quest failure had come into play. ... The major quest to destroy ten Dalki ships before ten planets had been taken over and the penalty was given. ... Judging by the size of the quest, Quinn thought the plenty would be big, but he had no idea just how large it was. ... First of all, he had lost a level, bringing Quinn back down to 69. ... He still was unsure if at 70 he would have evolved since both quests seemed to have finished around the same time. ... Still, the bad news didn't stop there. ... The penalty had continued, with Quinn taking a hit in his stat points. ... All of his stats were lowered by five.[Strength 65][Agility 65][Stamina 68][Charm 55]This seemed like a bigger hit than losing a level. ... After all, Quinn only got one stat point for each level up, so he thought the system was being excessive. ... It also made him wonder what the reward would have been if he had completed it. ... Still, beast gear could make up for these stats, and Quinn had thought of a solution to the problem. ... More people were being transported to the current Shelter they were staying at. ... The reason why Quinn had stopped taking drops of blood from his members was because he had already consumed that from all those on the Cursed ship. ... At the level he was at, it was taking a 100 to 200 drops of blood to gain a single stat point. ... However, with the number of new people in the Shelter, Quinn could easily gain the lost stats back by taking a drop of blood from each of them. ... The public now knew what Quinn was and hailed him as a hero. ... If he explained this would allow him to get stronger, he thought they would easily comply. ... Regardless of all that, the worst penalty was yet to come, and that was within 24 hours Quinn was to give the system a Demi-god tier item or higher. ... Or it would forcefully take one from him within that time.'The system keeps impressing me by the day.' Vincent said. ... 'All these penalties you have experienced were implemented in the game. ... When the user would die, at times, a random item would drop from that body. ... Of course, the system isn't expecting you to die, so maybe this is its version of it, taking an item from you.'Right now, Quinn didn't want to hear how impressed Vincent was with the system. ... He still had to explain Vincent to everyone at some point as well, but the looming timer over his head meant he would have to decide soon. ... The only equipment he had at the Demi-god tier or above was the Demon tier amulet, and the Demi-god tier gauntlets. ... Hilston's equipment had been damaged beyond repair as well, so Quinn had to make a choice, and he needed to do so soon.*******\n",

      "The timer was ticking down, and twelve hours wasn't enough time for Quinn to exactly go hunting. ... Although the teleporters were up and running on planet Caladi, the teleporters were no longer working on the planets that the Dalki had taken control of. ... They were assumed to be destroyed. ... The remaining planets that were still owned all had motherships that still had the jammers on board. ... The worst thing of all was the fact that Quinn was on a green portal planet. ... The highest tier beast that would be found here was an intermediate tier beast. ... It looked like in the end, Quinn had no choice but to give the system something.'Arghh, this countdown is torture. ... If I have to get rid of something, I might as well decide now.' Quinn thought. ... He had taken off the gauntlets and placed them both on the table in front of him and had done the same with the Demon tier amulet. ... The gauntlets both had a strong passive and active skill in each of them. ... If it wasn't for the poison, perhaps Quinn would have struggled more with Agent 2. ... At the same time, draining mana was undoubtedly handy, even against the Dragon Demon tier beast. ... However, how could he possibly think of getting rid of the Demon tier amulet when he had only just gotten it. ... With his stats having been lowered, the amulet was good in many ways. ... He could possibly travel to other planets where the Dalki numbers were few and obtain a few Marked. ... Quinn still wanted to perform his little test to see if he could evolve the Dalki himself, and then when needed, he could use them to boost his energy beyond the stats he lost. ... Even if the Dalki would no longer fall for his trick, he just couldn't see himself getting rid of it. ... \"I guess it's going to have to be the gauntlets then. ... \" Quinn sighed, but a thought came into his head. ... 'Does it have to be both of them? ... I know the gauntlets are a pair of weapons, but I can wear just one of them and still use their active and passive skills. ... In the first place, they were created with two Demi-god tier crystals. ... Maybe just giving one of the gauntlets would be enough?'The only problem was, Quinn was a little worried that if he made the offering, then maybe he couldn't take it back. ... If that was the case, then he would have given up the gauntlet for nothing.'What am I even worried about, I can just offer one, and if that doesn't work, the system would have taken them both anyway.' Quinn thought. ... In the end, Quinn had decided to offer the poison gauntlet. ... Although the passive skill on it was strong. ... It was too unreliable, and there was only a chance it could work. ... Quinn needed something more sure rather than rely on luck or chance, so he decided to keep the energy draining gauntlet. ... Picking up the gauntlet, Quinn started to think about the timer over his head. ... There was a ding sound and then a short wait. ... As if the system was trying to decide whether or not it would accept just one gauntlet instead of two.[The item has been selected][Are you sure you want to give up this item?]'Does that mean it worked?' He didn't want to do it, but he had to select the yes option in the end. ... A few seconds later, the gauntlet started to turn into particles, disappearing the same way Quinn could store crystals.'It is a loss, Quinn but remember you have gained a lot more from the system than losses. ... There might be a chance in the future that you are able to get the weapon back from the system.' Vincent said. ... This was what Quinn was worried about as well. ... With the quest and stakes of the world getting harder and harder he had seen a penalty for the first time. ... Would this become a regular thing? ... If so, then if Quinn started to fail these quests more and more, they would only get more difficult. ... Still, looking on the bright side, Quinn placed the energy drain gauntlet back in his dimensional space. ... It just meant he would have to get Alex to make him a new one.'I was thinking. ... I know using blood crystals is considered taboo. ... However, you have already created blood weapons from the others in your faction.' Vincent was trying to get at something. ... 'When I saw them using their weapons and how effective they were against the Dalki, I was thinking, why don't you create a gauntlet out of the blood crystals.'You have your soul weapon that acts in a similar way, and it gives you great power, but your soul weapon can only be used when there are multiple Dalki. ... If you were fighting against another five spike, then it would have been handy to have a powerful Blood weapon in hand.'It was a good suggestion to make. ... However, Quinn didn't have a large blood crystal that he could use to create a significant blood weapon. ... He had already given all the blood crystals away, but even then, it was just better off for him to create beast gear that would give him more stats than a medium grade blood weapon.'It would have been good if we had gotten Cindy's blood crystal back then. ... I doubt that Bryce has done anything with it. ... I'll keep it in mind if we ever do come across one.' Quinn said. ... Feeling a little bit better after only having to give up one of his gauntlets.'I haven't heard from Leo and Erin in a while. ... It would be best to see if everything is okay where they are and how things are doing in the vampire world.' Quinn thought. ... 'I thought that there would be some type of reaction when we announced ourselves as V, but there was nothing at all.''I agree that is certainly strange.' Vincent said. ... 'I'm sure Bryce has his eyes on what you are doing. ... Although the situation was unavoidable, perhaps they had decided to let it go. ... Still, I actually prefer it when we know what they are doing good or bad. ... When things are silent, I worry the most. ... Especially since we haven't seen or heard of Arthur moving yet.'What Quinn didn't know was that currently, Nathan was also on his way to Planet Caladi, and he wasn't alone. ... With him, he was travelling with Ruby and would be delivering the news of what he had learnt, as well as something special he had with him. ... While Quinn had been busy deciding what item to give back, the rest hadn't been slacking off either. ... In particular, the Blade family. ... Other than Quinn, they were the second highlight of the war. ... In good ways and bad ways. ... Since the world had learnt about them, their feelings were constantly changing. ... They hated them for killing Hilston, then thanking them for defeating the five spiked Dalki. ... The public felt like they were on a rollercoaster of emotions. ... After finishing helping build the Shelter, they were now helping out Logan with the ship's repairs. ... It was good for them because they wanted to get away from the people in the Shelter. ... At the moment, they were having a break and were sitting down in the sand, where the ship was being used to give them all shade. ... During this time, it was a little awkward between the group. ... There was Pai, and Vicky, the newcomers, who had decided to stay as they had nowhere else to go. ... It was actually an offer from Vorden. ... Then there was Sil, Raten and finally Borden as well. ... Soon though, the silence broke as Pai asked Vorden how he and Raten had gotten into such strange bodies. ... The one thing they wanted to avoid was talking about Hilston. ... \"So that's what happened, you guys must have been on some crazy journey, and it must be weird having a beast as a body,\" Pai said, looking towards the two of them. ... \"What about this one? ... \" Vicky pointed at Borden. ... \"Why does he look like Sil, and is he a Dalki? ... \"\"Thatâ¦might be a difficult question to answer,\" Vorden replied awkwardly. ... Because then he would have to go into detail of how they had discovered a Dalki creating a lab on a vampire planet. ... In a way, too many crazy things were happening to them all. ... \"So, are you two going to stay with us, or are you just bored or something? ... \" Raten asked. ... Both Pai and Vicky looked at each other with a guilty look on their faces. ... \"We aren't quite sure,\" Pai said. ... \"We think that we should help out with the situation as much as we can. ... To payback for what we have done, but we think there might be another problem that needs our attention. ... \"The Chained that were with us, all of them are free now, and that's not a good thing. ... Some of them have stayed in the Shelter and are going to be sent back to their families, I heard, but not everyone that Hilston kept with him was good. ... Some of them had dangerous abilities and were criminals. ... \"Hilston kept them for their abilities, but in a way, he was helping the world as well. ... People that could be considered for the position of the big four if they had the support and families to back them up. ... We might try going around and capturing them. ... \"Hearing this made Vorden smile. ... He always knew that Pai and Vicky were good people. ... Even if they didn't stay with them, he wanted them to do things based on their own choices. ... \"Before you go. ... \" Sil finally spoke. ... \"Tell meâ¦I want you to tell me, why did Hilston.. ... why did he do all of that, the Blade island, training us everything. ... \"******\n",

      "All of the Blade's knew what Sil had said to Hilston before he had decided to finish him off in the way he had done. ... The video that had been recorded was watched by them all multiple times, not just by them but nearly everyone in the Shelter. ... The drones had advanced technology that was able to pick up clear audio in a specific direction despite neither one of them not having microphones on their bodies. ... During the fight, Sil didn't exactly whisper the words to Hilston in his fit of anger either. ... It was then that Sil had claimed that he didn't care about the reason Hilston had done everything, that no matter what, it wouldn't make up for the crimes he had committed, but after the fight, something had changed. ... It had to have for Sil to suddenly ask this question to his brother and sister. ... This was due to the people around him, and not just any people, but those in the Cursed faction. ... He wasn't lying when he said he wanted Hilston to be the end of his journey, of his saga. ... Now that he was gone, there was no reason to worry about what that man did or was ever going to do. ... However, walking back through the Shelter, there were those that hailed the Blade family as heroes, congratulating them. ... They were the ones that had defeated the five spike that no one else could, while at the same time, some harboured anger towards them. ... Some of the Cursed members that Sil would walk past every day on the Cursed ship, were shaking when they would see him now. ... Hiding from his view while speaking whispers. ... It was clear they were scared of him. ... Why were they scared of him? ... Sil started to think, and eventually, he had come up with his own answer. ... It was the blood running through his veins, the Blade bloodline, the powerful ability that no one else could match up to. ... This family was the one that had attacked the Cursed faction, and what if it was to happen again. ... After asking the question, there was silence from Vicky and Pai. ... This was what allowed the time for Sil to have these thoughts. ... He was thinking back to those that were shaking at the sight of him, so Sil spoke again. ... \"Iâ¦. ... I just want to make sure that I don't turn out like him. ... I'm scared. ... I'm scared of this power. ... I'm scared of my body and all that training that we did. ... We all share his blood, don't we? ... What if there is something inside us that makes us become like him? ... \" Sil asked, both of his hands shaking. ... There was for a moment when he was fighting that he allowed the anger to consume him. ... It wasn't the first time he had this feeling which was why he was so concerned. ... He didn't want to admit it. ... Holding that much power gave a special feeling, something one couldn't explain. ... \"Haha, are you an idiot! ... \" Raten burst out laughing. ... \"Look at all of us, all of us carry the same blood, and every single one of us is different? ... We are all individual people regardless of what blood we have, and I mean, we're in freaking beast bodies at the moment. ... I'm not even sure if I have a spec of that dirty old man's blood in the first place. ... You are still a little child. ... \" Raten continued to laugh. ... \"I think what Raten is trying to say is, you really don't have to worry about that,\" Vorden added. ... \"Just because of who our parents are, doesn't define who we are. ... You have a right to worry though because I too would like to know just what was that man doing, what was he trying to do. ... \"Now, Vorden and Sil were waiting for an answer from the other two. ... \"Alright, would you two just stop looking at me like that? ... \" Vicky said, scratching her head irritated. ... \"Look, you aren't going to like what I have to say, but I don't have a clue either. ... When we joined the castle, all we did was follow what Hilston told us to do, just like you guys. ... \"From time to time, he would tell us to go places. ... All we did was fight, Honestly if you want to know more, then the one you really should be asking is our so called mother and father. ... They would have a better answer, but I have no clue where they have gone just like you. ... \"It was disappointing for them to hear. ... Their curiosity was now consuming them. ... Their whole life they lived, there had to be some sort of goal, right? ... Otherwise, the lives of their brothers and sisters were lost for nothing. ... \"I do know one thing. ... \" Pai interrupted, and from the looks of it, Vicky was surprised to hear this as well. ... \"I just heard the old man mumbling once, but the reason why he puts us through extreme measures again and again, why he keeps making as many Blade children as possible. ... Maybe this is linked. ... \"I don't know what his goal was or why he was doing it, but he was looking for a Blade, one that could use a soul weapon. ... \"All of their eyes lit up hearing this, apart from Borden, who didn't have a clue what was going on and was finding it hard to keep track. ... Still, he was interested to learn of his brother's crazy family origins. ... They were all surprised because they knew that Blade's were unable to have soul weapons. ... They had all tried to summon it at one point, and it failed. ... They thought that it might be due to how their ability worked, that it was just impossible for them to have a soul weapon. ... If they even had one, they would have no clue what it would be. ... \"Why would he be looking for a Blade with a soul weapon? ... I mean, I understand if he was someone who cared about the family, but I don't see how it benefits him at all. ... \" Vorden said. ... It certainly was a head scratcher, but they would just have to ask their mother and father to find out the missing pieces. ... All of the communicators they had on them, given by Logan, started to vibrate again, signalling it was time for them to use their muscles and such to get back to work. ... Heading back inside the Cursed ship, Vorden looked at Sil from behind.'Hilston was obsessed with getting Sil back. ... I thought it might have been due to him being able to hold six abilities, but what if it was because of a different reason? ... Is it true, can Sil really use a soul weapon? ... If so, it would be a big help to the war. ... Perhaps Sil is someone who can go even beyond Hilston, and we are going to need people like that if we are going to face more five Spike Dalki. ... The problem is, can Sil handle that much responsibility? ... Although he is the same age as us, he has been mentally hit since a young age.'Only now has it started to get better, but as long as I and Raten stay by his side, we can keep him in control. ... Sil, we will look after you and make sure you stay on the right path, and if we aren't there, then I know Quinn will.'Speaking off Quinn, he was now finally ready to leave the office. ... He had been sulking around for long enough about the penalty. ... In the end, it wasn't something he couldn't deal with. ... A loss of an item was something he could always get back, and his stats could improve. ... His powers, Qi, skills he had learnt and experience, all of it was still there. ... Putting his plan into motion, Quinn had called Sam and asked him if he could require that all of those in the Shelter donate blood. ... Quinn didn't quite explain the reason but said that he needed it for himself. ... The other vampires didn't get stronger by consuming different types of blood. ... This was something unique to Quinn, so it was hard to explain. ... Luckily, it seemed like Sam believed that this wouldn't be too hard of a request.'I can mix the blood into flasks and take them at the same time. ... My Qi has increased since the last time as well, and by mixing the two carefully together, I can make sure that the blood lust doesn't go out of control. ... It might take a while, but my stats will be back to what they were.'Any second now, Sach and the others would arrive, and Quinn needed to be ready with a plan and what to do next. ... After all, even with the penalty, he was still one of the main powerhouses, and the Demon amulet could be put to good use. ... Swinging the door open, Quinn was ready for a smile, but immediately, someone was standing on the other end of the door. ... His smile had disappeared. ... \"What the hell are you doing here? ... \" Quinn asked. ... \"What a kind welcome, and here I thought you would be embracing me with a big hug. ... Did you miss me? ... \" Richard Eno asked.******\n",

      "It had been a while Since Quinn had last seen Eno. ... Still, it was a face that he wouldn't forget for a long time. ... The last time the two of them had met was on Blade island, where they had decided to part ways. ... Honestly, when opening the door, it was the last person he was expecting to see on the other side. ... Usually, others would contact Quinn when they wanted to see him, but Eno would just appear whenever he wished.'How did he know where I was in the first place? ... How did he even know I was in this room? ... Does he have a tracker in my system or something?!'The reason for Quinn's unhappy appearance was because whenever this person appeared, he always did something that Quinn didn't exactly agree with, which was why now, of all things, he was on his toes for what was just about to happen next. ... \"I saw the video of you. ... It looks like you have improved and exceeded my expectations like you have been doing this whole time. ... \" Eno said as he walked past him as if the office was his own home. ... \"Although you could have made it easier on yourselves, you could have gone for the attack while Hilston was fighting. ... We might have just lost our Queen in this fight and traded for theirs. ... \"The problem is, they have more than one Queen. ... \"Quinn understood that when Eno was using the words 'Queen', he was referring to the game of chess. ... Where the Queen was the most powerful piece, but each side only had one. ... In this case, their Queen would have been Hilston. ... As for the Dalki side, Quinn knew they had more than one five spike. ... \"How much do you know? ... \" Quinn asked. ... \"Do you know how many five spikes they have? ... Do you know about their strange chamber? ... \"There was clear information that Eno knew that he was keeping from them, but why didn't he share this information with the human race? ... Wouldn't they have a better chance of surviving if they knew? ... At the same time, Quinn wanted to ask just what Eno was doing here, but while he was here, he might as well ask him some of the other questions he wanted to know. ... \"I think what you are asking for is fair, especially since you finally managed to defeat one of the major threats,\" Eno said, now sitting in the seat that Quinn was in before. ... \"It looks like you have been busy yourself if you already know about that strange chamber of theirs. ... As you know the Dalki have been evolving in general, and it might have to do with the special chamber. ... \"At first, I thought that the Dalki would be the ones that were time sensitive, but now it seems the humans are. ... \"Quinn couldn't agree more. ... Although he was unable to experience the healing properties of the chamber, if what the five spike said was true, then Quinn could see them forcing evolutions. ... \"The major threats I speak of are as follows. ... There are three Dalki that can turn the tide of any battle and would be a huge blow if defeated to the enemy side. ... One Horn, who had managed to defeat Oscar, another five spike that goes by the name Graham, and lastly a Dalki named Green Horn. ... \"The last of the three is the weakest, only being a four spike. ... However, it is on the stronger side and is the closest to evolving at the moment. ... it also was the one that had escaped after fighting against Owen. ... \"Thinking back to the five spikes that Quinn had met while being in a Dalki body, he could only assume that he was the one called Graham, since One Horn's appearance was known to the whole place. ... The next question for Quinn would be how did Eno know this information in the first place, but when asking in the past he got no answer. ... He assumed he was just being safe, not wanting to give his sources away in case anything happened to them. ... \"So, if we get rid of these three, the human race will win the war? ... \" Quinn asked, getting a better idea of just what was left of this war. ... \"I haven't finished naming the major threats. ... Jim, the ex vampire leader and ex vampire knight, also my, or should I say our relative is a big problem as well. ... In the past, he would do anything to please his curiosity and achieve his goal, and I'm sure it is the same now. ... There is no telling how strong he is or who he has by his side helping him. ... \"When hearing this, Quinn's mind went to True Dream and the one that was able to control the vampire agents. ... Two strong ability users. ... \"Lastly, we have to face the fact that Jim could be using Arthur in some way. ... Although we can't be sure, he is working for Jim. ... There is a good chance whatever he is doing could get in our way. ... The important thing is Quinn, now that I have told you all our enemies we have to face, I'm sure you know, you can not beat them all on your own. ... \"It was food for thought. ... Still, a part of Quinn didn't believe Arthur had gone over to the other side. ... Otherwise, why would he have let him live? ... Arthur was almost telling him to get stronger, and there had to be a reason for it. ... \"Okay, then tell me why you came here. ... Aren't you supposed to be protecting that Demon tier beast? ... \" Quinn asked. ... Standing up, Eno straightened his dark blazer and started to walk back to the exit where Quinn was standing. ... \"A meeting is to take place, no? ... The matter I need to bring up will concern everyone. ... As I said, if we want to survive this, we will need everyone's help on this. ... Let me just say that this whole war is a distraction in the first place. ... \"Walking out of the room, Eno continued to do his own thing, and as usual, Quinn was swept up in his pace. ... It was either that or leave the crazy old man alone. ... In a way, Quinn thought that would be worse. ... When stepping out of the office and heading down the hallway, he was quite surprised to see someone familiar standing there. ... In a pointy hat, and black outfit Mona gave a little wave. ... \"I saw your flashy moves out there. ... \" Mona complimented. ... \"You did a good job. ... I thought at first that maybe you weren't deserving to replace one of the big four, and then in a flash, you go ahead and surpass us. ... Who would have thought. ... \"For some reason, seeing Mona made Quinn a little at ease. ... He thought she was quite sensible, to say the least. ... If she and Eno were travelling together that she wasn't shy enough to say if he was doing something out of order or strange. ... It did make Quinn wonder where Brock was though. ... The most likely answer was still on the island. ... \"It looks like everyone saw that video, huh? ... \" Quinn replied, not realising just how viral it had gone. ... \"I would bet there isn't a single human who hasn't seen it,\" Eno said, clearing his throat. ... \"Would you mind? ... These old legs of mine are getting a little tired. ... \"At first, Quinn didn't know what Eno meant by this. ... He was sure that his legs were working fine.'Does he want a piggyback or something?'Later he realised that Eno was trying to hint at them using Quinn's shadow to travel. ... The meeting was far, and Quinn wanted to avoid the people outside, so he would use it anyway. ... The meeting wasn't to occur in the Shelter since there were too many people, and it would attract attention. ... Instead, it would take place on the Cursed ship. ... Although Repairs weren't finished yet, the command centre had been repaired so they could have full use of it. ... Both Mona and Eno were taken inside and out of the Shelter using his shadow travel. ... As they approached the Cursed ship, Quinn saw another ship had already landed while another was preparing to land. ... Soon, Quinn could see who had gotten off the ship, for it was Nathan, along with a few others by his side. ... The others with him were just soldiers for protection, but Quinn didn't recognise the person directly behind him. ... It was a female, she stayed close, but he did notice something else that she was holding onto tightly. ... The next second, Quinn had popped out of the shadow, appearing in front of them all. ... \"Quinn! ... What the! ... You can't just pop out of the sand like that. ... Were you hiding there that whole time! ... \" Nathan had let out a little shriek. ... These days he was a little on edge and wasn't paying attention. ... To suddenly see three people appear out of a shadow in the sand like that would give anyone a fright. ... However, Quinn ignored Nathan and instead looked at the weapon held in the woman's hands. ... \"That weapon that's the Demon tier beast weapon that Oscar had! ... I'm sure of it! ... \" Quinn said, recognising it. ... After all, he was one of the few that had seen it being used in action.'Didn't Sach say that they lost it when fighting against one horn, and it was on the planet where Arthur was, so why is it in this person's hands?'At the same time, while Quinn was thinking this. ... The woman who was known as Ruby also seemed a little starstruck after seeing Quinn. ... \"You, what you did just now, that looked like a shadow, do you have shadow abilities? ... \" Ruby asked. ... No matter what skill Quinn would use, even the shadow travel when deactivating and activating the skill, shadows would form like a type of purple fog and quickly disappear. ... Ruby had seen the same thing happen before. ... \"Do you know where Arthur is? ... \" Ruby asked. ... This girl knew who Arthur was? ... This was something Quinn wasn't expecting, just who was this girl, and what was her relationship with Arthur.******\n",

      "🔊 [Chapter 550] Preparing: Chapter 1248: Arthur Switch sides? ... Hearing Arthur's name was like a switch in Quinn's mind. ... He never expected to hear the name from another person's lips, especially a human. ... To make sure, Quinn sniffed a few times. ... The scent was definitely that of a human. ... \"Why! ... \" Quinn said, pushing forward now almost directly in Ruby's face. ... \"Why do you know that name? ... How do you know him? ... Who are You? ... \"Asking one question after another, Quinn pushed forward, and Ruby was taking a step back. ... The person in front of her was being somewhat aggressive, and it felt like if she said one wrong word, she would be on the receiving end of an attack. ... Instead of answering, she slowly moved her hands down to the hilt of the sword she had been practically hugging till recently, but this didn't go unnoticed by Quinn. ... \"Don't you try to use that weapon on me. ... \" Quinn demanded as his eyes glowed red and his influence skill had activated. ... No matter how hard Ruby tried to move her hand, her body wouldn't listen to her as it was being controlled.'Those red eyes are the same as Arthur's. ... I thought that maybe the two of them knew each other. ... Is he going to kill me ?' She thought. ... \"Quinn! ... What are you doing! ... \" Nathan shouted out as he got in between the two of them. ... \"Look, I don't know who this Arthur person is, Ruby does know him, but you can't just ask a question and put pressure on someone like that the second you meet them. ... You didn't even give her time to answer. ... \"I know this might be out of place since I am ranked below you, but I have to call out your actions. ... Do you want to be like Duke! ... \" Nathan shouted, trying to get Quinn's head screwed back on properly. ... Letting go of the Influence skill, Quinn took a step back. ... He realised that he had allowed his emotions to get the better of him, similar to when he had faced Head general Innu. ... This wasn't Innu though, and neither was it Arthur himself.'I have to calm myself down when it comes to situations involving Arthur. ... Every time I hear his name, the wounds on my body start to ache a little.'\"I understand the young one,\" Eno said, walking up to Quinn's side. ... \"I too am interested in knowing just how this girl came into possession of the Demon tier weapon and her relationship with Arthur. ... \"It took a few seconds for Nathan to notice who it was, but it was then that he recognised the man as Richard Eno. ... Immediately he bowed down, showing his respect to one of the great heroes. ... \"I'm sorry,\" Quinn said, looking at Ruby again. ... \"I'm just trying to find him and wondering what he is doing at the moment. ... Do you mind if you tell me what you know about him? ... \"Many things were running through Ruby's mind when she saw Quinn use the shadow powers. ... Whether he was a friend of Arthur, an Enemy or perhaps someone who was just searching for him, but now she realised that they both had similar goals. ... The group started to make their way into the cursed ship. ... While doing so, Ruby had explained just like she did with Nathan, who Arthur was and how he was introduced into the Shelter they had made.'What she's saying matches up with what Leo and Erin told me before, how they had trained with Arthur on the planet. ... So she is from the place where we woke up Arthur and must be part of those that were left behind when the portal planet changed.' \"So you don't really know why the Dalki were protecting the place? ... \" Quinn asked. ... \"I hate to say It, but it is looking more and more likely that Arthur is working for the other side now. ... He must have made some sort of deal to have the Dalki protect them. ... Arthur is a strong ally for them to have, which is why they went as far as to have One Horn keep their promise. ... \" After finishing this sentence, Eno had a smile on his face. ... \"However, in their rush to attack, you have managed to do a great thing. ... You have made it, so their deal is void. ... \"\"Who is this Arthur person you keep speaking of? ... \" Nathan couldn't help but ask. ... \"From the sound of it, it is a great figure, but I have never heard of such a name. ... \"\"If I said he was someone who is stronger than Quinn, then I bet that would get your attention, so it is important to know if he is working for the Dalki or not,\" Eno answered. ... Hearing this, Nathan stopped walking for a few seconds. ... Right now, it wouldn't be wrong to say that Quinn was the strongest person in the world. ... At least, from who they knew, yet an unknown was stronger than him. ... \"Wait, but Arthur said, I mean Ruby said that Arthur said the Dalki were even stronger than him! ... What does that mean! ... \" Nathan shouted out, recalling her words. ... Now, both Quinn and Eno had stopped walking at the same time. ... \"It's true,\" Ruby added, looking at the shock on their faces. ... She didn't really know who this Quinn person was because they had been kept away from the outside world, so she also didn't know what the big deal was that someone was stronger than him, or Arthur for that matter. ... \"When Arthur came back with the Dalki, he said those words. ... \"Thinking things through, Quinn was trying to compare Arthur's strength with Slicers. ... From both fights and what he had seen Arthur do before, out of a hundred fights with Slicer, Quinn couldn't imagine Arthur losing a single one of them.'Could it be, did Arthur already have a scuffle with the Dalki, did he lose? ... Is that why he attacked me that time with the Demon tier beast and told me to get stronger. ... Because not even he could beat the Dalki?'This was the only thing he could think of, but to know for sure, he had to know the deal made with the humans. ... The only thing he could think of was if Arthur really thought the Dalki was going to win this war. ... His deal was for the Shelter to be saved. ... Did he get attached to those at the Shelter so quickly? ... \"About what you said earlier,\" Ruby added. ... \"Even if the Dalki aren't protecting us anymore and we have escaped, I think Arthur would still help them because they still have my.... ... daughter. ... Arthur and Minny, the two of them, would always go off together, but one day she had gone missing, and it was around the same time Arthur appeared with them. ... I know Arthur wouldn't hurt her! ... \"Looking to his right, Quinn could see that Eno was in deep thought as well. ... Perhaps someone being stronger than Arthur was never in his calculations. ... Eno had the insight to see far ahead, but there were things even he couldn't predict. ... \"What are you thinking? ... \" Quinn asked. ... \"The timeline,\" Eno replied. ... \"You see, if you asked me, could the Dalki get strong enough to defeat Arthur? ... My answer would have been yes, but judging by when these people were being protected by the Dalki, and when you claimed you were attacked by him. ... It would mean that at that time, they already had someone strong enough to deal with Arthur. ... \"If that is true and was the case, then that said person or Dalki is now even stronger than back then. ... The Dalki are improving quicker than my predictions. ... They might have a six spike already among them, or one that is very close to evolving. ... \"It was a scary thought to even imagine what a six spike would be like. ... For the rest of the walk, there was silence among them all. ... Finally, the group had entered the meeting room, where Logan and Sam were present inside. ... It looked like the command centre had not only been repaired but improvements had been made to the room as well. ... The main table that would sit a level above all the controls was now twice the size it was before. ... The centre and the table itself could still be used as a holographic display, and it looked like it was being used as one now. ... Currently being projected into the meeting, was Owen, Helen, and Samantha. ... The holograms looked life-like as if they were actually present in the room. ... From the smell alone, Quinn knew they weren't. ... In the room already, other than Sam and Logan, was the new Supreme commander Sach. ... \"Quinn, we were just talking about you,\" Sach said with a smile. ... \"We were all discussing the video of you beating the five spike. ... \"At first, Quinn thought that maybe the meeting had started without him, but it looked like everyone was just chatting and getting along with one another. ... \"Oh, I see you have brought some others with you as well,\" Sach said, surprised, but he wasn't the only one. ... \"Mona, my word, I thought you had perished, darling,\" Owen said, spooked, thinking he had seen a ghost. ... \"I'm harder to kill than you think, and I have this person to thank for that,\" Mona said, pointing towards Richard Eno. ... The group took to their seats now the meeting was about to start. ... Sach was going to take the lead, giving everyone an update on all of the current situations, but before he even could, Eno stood up. ... \"I have come bringing urgent news to everyone. ... This whole war that you are all facing, is a giant trap! ... The Dalki don't care about the beast planets. ... This is just a distraction from their real goal. ... What they really are after, is planet earth. ... \"We have to do everything we can to protect planet earth, no more importantly protect Blade island. ...

      "When Eno stood up and spoke, the rest of them were hanging on to his every word. ... There was something about the way he spoke, making them feel that it was of great importance, so they took everything he said seriously. ... After explaining to the others that Earth needed to be protected, there was a bit of catching up to do for the rest of humanity. ... It was time that the World Leaders, the ones involved, and the ones that were risking their lives to fight the threat actually knew what they were fighting against and why. ... Everyone in the room knew what Eno was since the announcement of V. ... Quinn was the one who had outed him in the first place, claiming that he was the reason the Cursed faction leader had been turned into a V. ... However, most of this had been said to Oscar, and they weren't sure how much of it had been passed down. ... Eno decided to start from the beginning, admitting to being a vampire for those that didn't know in the room. ... Also revealing how the vampires had tried to create a blood substitute so they would no longer have to rely on humans, which was what led to the creation of the Dalki. ... As someone in the know, Quinn could tell that just like himself, Eno made sure to withhold the fact that there were still plenty of vampires out there, inhabiting an entire planet even. ... The old man made sure to only share the information that was needed for his current story. ... \"As a failed experiment the Dalki are incomplete beings, their lifespan being short and finite. ... It is their goal to do everything they can to survive, and for that they require a Demon tier beast that is currently on Blade Island. ... They will come for it soon. ... \" Eno finished his explanation there. ... Only a select few had known about the real goal of the Dalki, most had believed them to merely be a genocidal race who had out for humans. ... It was a lot to take in for the uninformed, but because it had come from the Great Richard Eno himself, nobody questioned the validity. ... \"This whole situation is so crazy. ... \" Samantha couldn't help but blurt out. ... \"I have a few questions to ask if I may. ... \" Owen interjected. ... \"First of all, why don't we kill the Demon tier beast? ... That way the Dalki should have no more reason to attack Earth, right? ... \"\"You make it sound easy. ... \" Mona laughed seriously at this suggestion. ... \"We have already visited the island with a group of us and even Quinn admitted that it wasn't anything we could just defeat. ... What's more, that thing isâ¦ strange. ... \"A realisation hit the others, if the Demon tier beast was too strong for them to handle, and the Dalki had decided to attack now, it must have meant they had a way to either control the Demon tier beast or were sure that they could beat it to take it back. ... \"Do we know how they are planning to attack? ... \" Sach asked. ... \"At the moment, the teleportation station is being heavily guarded. ... Although the Dalki have cornered us, they still aren't close enough to reach the teleportation system to head to Earth's solar system. ... \"\"That's because it won't be the Dalki that are attacking. ... I predict that they will have their hands full dealing with the humans, just like they have done now and that the vampire I spoke of earlier, will be the one to lead the attack. ... \" \"The V that is working with Dalki, he is a great mind like myself. ... Getting to Earth will pose no problem for him. ... I'm sure you are already aware that one Dalki has managed to appear on the planet, without any prior warning signs. ... You can be sure that more will follow. ... \"It was an issue that nobody in their group currently had a way of solving. ... Even if the Dalki were after Earth, it didn't change the fact that most of their forces were currently engaged with the Dalki on the beast planets. ... At the moment, there was only a small group protecting Earth, and the wealthiest of civilians.'Quinn, I'm afraid that the others don't really understand the real threat in allowing the Dalki to obtain the Demon tier beast.' Vincent voiced his opinion, while everyone was deep in thought, discussing measures and certain tactics. ... At the moment, they were estimating how long their forces could last, with the amount of beast crystal they had.'Do you remember the state that Leo described the Demon tier beast was in? ... He said that it appeared to be in a deep slumber. ... From the information I have gathered and what I have observed I believe that this was the case because half of the Demon tier beast has already had all its energy drained.''The Dalki were created with one half of the Demon tier beast and Logan said that there wasn't enough energy to create anymore Dalki after Borden, but the beast is still somewhat alive. ... If it wasn't it would have joined back up with the beast on Earth.' 'If the Dalki get their hands on the second half of the Demon tier beast there will be two major issues. ... One, they could use the Demon tier that still has plenty of energy left to create more incomplete Dalki.' 'Two, their goal would change. ... Rather than capturing the other half of the Demon tier beast, they could simply slay the one on the vampire's side, gaining control over the complete version of it.'When hearing Vincent explain it, the terror of them getting the Demon tier beast set in. ... So far the humans were only able to put up a decent fight due to their numbers, but if their forces could double, there would be no hope for them. ... \"I agree. ... \" Quinn said, interrupting the others that were speaking. ... \"We have to prevent the Dalki from obtaining the Demon tier beast at all costs. ... I'm aware that everyone is busy defending the invaded planets and that they are worried that if they leave them, there will be no hope for them to survive, but if we allow them to get their hands on that Demon tier beast they will be able to double their numbers, if not worse! ... \"There was something else Quinn realised that he decided to keep to himself as well. ... Arthur had made a deal with the Dalki, so what were they getting from him? ... If what Vincent theorised was true, Arthur might have been tasked with killing the Demon tier beast that was in the Vampire World. ... \"I see that you are all troubled so I have a suggestion. ... \" Sam spoke up. ... \"The main issue we have at the moment is travel. ... The Dalki possess the technology to block our own teleporters. ... Were it not for that, we could assign people to protect Blade Island, and you could head back to your respective planets in case they would need the reinforcements. ... \"\"Thanks to Quinn and Logan, we were able to create a device that can be used to disrupt their jamming device. ... At the moment, the Dalki don't know about it. ... This could be our trump card against them! ... When Eno calls for help from us all, we can travel and protect Blade Island! ... \"The others were amazed by how much the Cursed faction had been able to help in this fight. ... If it wasn't for Quinn and his friends humanity would have long since perished. ... \"I can agree to that. ... \" Owen nodded. ... \"As long as the Greylash planets and its people can be protected at any time, I will gladly go where I'm most needed. ... Providing the teleporters work of course. ... \"Soon after, the rest of them agreed to this fact and a plan was put in place. ... For now, Eno, along with Mona, would head back to Blade Island and set up the teleporters. ... They would also stay there as a first line of defence. ... Eno actually wanted Quinn to send some of his people back as well, but the Vampire Lord himself had refused, on the grounds that there were things he needed to do with them first. ... Seeing the look in his eyes, Eno understood that Quinn wouldn't budge. ... Given the situation, it was apparent that Quinn must have intended to boost their strength as much as he could. ... Up until now, they had done well and they had yet to let him down, so Eno didn't insist on their arrival. ... The teleporters working was a big win for them. ... Additionally, Quinn did agree to send someone with the shadow ability over, so he could go there regardless if the teleporters were working or not. ... \"The next matter to be discussed is those that are known as the Chained. ... \" Sam stated standing up. ... \"Hilston Blade has enslaved many strong people to have access to their abilities. ... A good portion of them have remained on Planet Caladi. ... \"\"Some of these are the strongest ability users in their field, including past leaders. ... They will be returned to their rightful factions. ... \"Hearing this, there was a smile on Owen's face. ... During the broadcast he had seen the face of his grandfather Grim Graylash still alive. ... Reclaiming those people who had been believed to have died, was a big win for the Graylash family as well as the Earthborn group as a whole. ... \"Before we go on to discuss each group's plans and tactics for the fight against the Dalki, Nathan has one more matter he wishes to address. ... \" Sam sat back down in his seat to allow him to take over. ... Nathan then stood up, with Ruby still sitting by his side. ... \"Supreme Commander Sach had given me an important mission while the attack was going on. ... With One Horn's location having been confirmed on a different planet we knew it was the right opportunity to strike, and in doing so we rescued the humans. ... \"While Nathan was speaking, Samantha suddenly sparked up, because she knew exactly what planet they were talking about. ... \"It turns out that the humans there had not been V at all, nor had they been working with the Dalki. ... The Dalki had kept them alive, glorified prisoners, probably to be used against us in some way. ... \" When Nathan said this, he was careful because he realised that neither Richard, nor Quinn had mentioned this Arthur person. ... Since the latter seemed to be a V as well, he took that as a sign that it could be a secret they didn't wish to share. ... As such, he chose to do the same. ... \"We have successfully freed them, and in doing so we have managed to retrieve this! ... \"Ruby, then placed the Demon tier weapon on the table for them all to see. ... \"Although it was our Cursed faction who discovered and secured the weapon, it originally belonged to the Earthborn group. ... Without Supreme Commander Oscar, we will have to choose the most suitable person to wield the sword for all of humanity's sake! ... \"Everyone's eyes were now glued onto the weapon. ... A Demon tier Weapon would be a boost to them all, and every single group wanted it for themselves.******Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "The Demon tier weapon was special in more ways than one. ... Not just because of the rank of the weapon itself, but due to the history it carried as well. ... As the first Demon tier weapon that the humans had owned and the one belonging to the supreme commander. ... In a way, everyone in the room had a case for the weapon to be rightfully theirs. ... It was at that moment while everyones eyes were glued to the weapon that Ruby stood up. ... \"In return for saving those in the Shelter and giving them a safe place to live, I have agreed to give back this weapon. ... If it can help me bring back my daughter, and help save us from this war with the Dalki and many lives, then I accept. ... \" Ruby said, sitting back down. ... Hearing Ruby's words, and how selfless they had been, made the others reconsider for a second. ... A normal person had actually tasted what it was like to use and wield a Demon tier weapon. ... In times like this, nearly everyone would want to keep it for themselves. ... Her strong words resonated with the others and the first one to actually speak was Owen. ... \"At the moment, the Graylash faction lacks a Demon tier weapon. ... Our strength comes from our ability. ... I would have before said that using the weapon would have made it so there wasn't just one strong contender in the Graylash family, but thanks to the Cursed faction that isn't true anymore. ... \"\"I have them to thank that I will be reunited with my grandfather, Grim Graylash who is an even stronger lightning user than my father. ... He alone is worth more than a Demon tier weapon. ... On top of that I owe Quinn my life. ... Although I know handing the Weapon to the Cursed faction will make their power even greater than the others, I can't think of anyone more deserving. ... \"Of course, Quinn was also interested in the Demon tier Sword. ... Although it seemed rather selfish, he believed that in the Cursed faction's hand it could be put to better use than if anyone else were to get it. ... He was aware that his own swordsmanship would be lacking, but Leo would eventually come back and he could do with a better weapon. ... 'Although it isn't a katana blade so how would he fare with this type of sword, would it still be useful for him?'\"Honestly, I'm not completely against the idea. ... \" Sach said after hearing what Owen had to say. ... \"Afterall, the Cursed faction was ultimately the one who dealt with the five spiked Dalki. ... Under the old system it would have made them eligible to demand any type of reward, given their contribution it could have even been the sword. ... \"\"However, there are a couple of problems. ... For one the Board wouldn't exactly agree to such a thing. ... I know you guys don't know much about them, but any major decision has to go through them. ... They are a group of ten families that in the past had originally supported the current military, especially during the first war with finances and more. ... \"\"The problem is they worry too much. ... If we were to hand the Demon tier weapon to the Cursed faction, I can already hear them complain that you guys will have a monopoly on power. ... Rather than thinking that we might not win this war and we should do everything we can to win this war, they are overly worried about themselves. ... \"\"Although it was thanks to them, and the seats voted that I am in the position I am in now, I just don't think they would allow this to go through. ... \"It came as a surprise to Quinn. ... Being in the position he was in he was unaware of how the military worked. ... The leader over the entire military in the public eye had been the Supreme Commander, which was why Quinn's hatred for the old system had been aimed against Oscar. ... However, upon meeting him for the first time, he had felt that the old man had been far from the big villain he had pictured him in the past. ... \"Ah, yes that's right, I was asked to put a vote in recently, I guess that had to do with you. ... \" Logan casually said. ... Everyone's head at the table, then turned to look at Logan. ... Without realising it he had just outed himself as one of the ten families that were on the Board. ... \"Wait, the Green family is on the Board?! ... \" Nathan asked in surprise. ... \"Well, I can't say it's too surprising. ... \" Mona added. ... \"Their systems are integrated into the military and they have money reserves beyond belief. ... Of course it would make sense for them to be on the Board. ... \"What Sach didn't mention was that the members of those ten families on the Board had been kept secret, for their overall safety. ... The reason why Logan had to give a vote was because his family was no longer alive apart from him. ... Sach cleared his throat, indicating that he had more to say. ... \"Regardless of this fact, I don't think one vote would make a difference in this. ... The main reason I'm bringing this up is because of Samantha. ... \" Sach said pointing towards her. ... \"It's pretty much a given that the Board will insist that she has the right to the weapon more than anyone. ... Especially since it belonged to her father. ... \"Thinking about this, Quinn was a bit troubled about taking the Demon tier weapon away from her. ... After all, Oscar had once told him about how much he and his people had gone through to obtain that thing. ... \"I also wish for it to go to the Cursed faction. ... \" Samantha finally spoke. ... \"Honestly, even if it was in my hands, I am not confident that we can defeat One Horn with it. ... Then, there is even at least another five spiked Dalki out there, and unlike the Board who are unaware of what goes on, I do know it would be best suited in your hands. ... \"With this, it seemed like the matter was settled. ... At least between all the World Leaders it was. ... Since all of them wished to hand the weapon to the Cursed faction. ... However, there was still the fact that the Board wouldn't exactly be pleased with this outcome, putting Sach in a difficult position.'What can the people on the Board do about it, anyway? ... They might not be happy, but are they going to force it from us? ... Surely, they can't be crazy enough to start a fight with the Cursed faction in a time like this?' Quinn wondered. ... From the look on Quinn's face Sach could tell what he was thinking. ... \"They have a great influence, Quinn. ... Just think about how powerful the Green family is. ... Maybe it won't bother you, but they could easily turn public opinion against you. ... \" Sach said. ... \"That would be annoying, to say the least. ... \" Sam commented, but he already had an idea in mind. ... \"How about this? ... Nathan is part of the Cursed group, and barely anyone should know that Sach was the one to have sent him out on this mission. ... Why not let Quinn claim to have ordered such a mission and that we coincidentally managed to retrieve the weapon? ... \"\"This makes it so the Earthborn group is even more indebted to the Cursed faction. ... As a publicity stunt, Quinn hands the weapon to the Earthborn group Samantha, this will show that the connection between the Cursed and Earthborn group is close to those on the outside. ... \"\"Then, Samantha can just choose to give it back to us. ... Since it's rightfully hers to keep, nobody should be able to complain if she does as she wishes, especially if it's done for the sake of humanity. ... \"It sounded like a long winded process but ultimately they believed that this would work and keep everyone happy. ... Since this discussion had ended, it was time for the rest of them to talk about their situation on the planets, and what they had planned to do. ... It seemed like scuffles on the planets were happening every once in a while, but strong forces were no longer attacking like they had done before. ... This was good news and bad news, as the Dalki could be waiting for them to run out of crystals. ... Due to the situation it seemed like each group would have to come up with their own defensive measures, which would be implemented on a case by case basis as and when attacks happened. ... What they did agree on was that they wouldn't go on the attack. ... Not until they had successfully defended Blade Island from the practically guaranteed attack. ... With that the meeting was over and everyone rushed off to do their own thing for now. ... \"Quinn, before I go remember what I said. ... You have done well so far and you need to continue to do so. ... I will also play my part in all this. ... \" That was all that Eno had to say. ... For the first time, the old man didn't have any intentions of sticking around. ... For now, the others were preparing just how they would do the handling of the Demon tier weapon. ... Sam was calling for Bonny and Void to hold a press conference, leaving Quinn to do his own thing. ... Sach would stay for the filming process before heading off back to Samantha. ... Walking around the ship, Quinn was looking for a few certain individuals, and found them repairing one of the training rooms, the Balde family. ... \"Quinn! ... \" Sil shouted with a smile, breaking his concentration, dropping a giant metal slab he was holding up with his powers, but before it could drop to the floor, Vicky lifted it back up and put it in place, for Borden and Vorden to do the rest of the repairs. ... It was still weird for Quinn to see Pai and Vicky, the last time he had seen them he was fighting with his life on the line, but with Sil and the others there he felt safer. ... One thing he was glad about was that he wouldn't have to ever fight them again. ... At least he hoped that would be the case. ... After finishing the repairs, Vorden soon came over to Quinn, along with Borden and Sil. ... The others didn't care for Quinn too much. ... \"So what brings you here, I hope you don't need our help to take down another five spikes, I don't want to do that ever again. ... \" Vorden half-joked. ... Quinn laughed nervously, because in a way he did want them for something along those lines. ... \"Actually I have a gift for you guys. ... I know how much help I need from you and there might be a time when we all need to fight like that again. ... So I have to make sure that you guys are as strong as you can be. ... \"Quinn took a step back and lifted his hands. ... Hundreds upon hundreds of beast crystals started falling onto the ground, piling up. ... All these crystals were from the mothership he had taken down. ... \"I doubt Muddy and Tails will mind, but I need their bodies to evolve! ... \"****Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "When Quinn had first seen all the different levels of beast crystals on board the Dalki Mothership, the first thought he had in his mind was that he could use them to evolve both Vorden and Raten. ... There weren't any tier crystals beyond that of the king tier, so there was no need for them to be used as equipment. ... Besides, there was something better they could get out of it. ... A Demon tier beast as an ally was unheard of. ... Even Mona, who was part of the big four, could only control a Demi-god tier beast. ... At the same time, it was beneficial for both of them as well. ... The whole world was currently in a war. ... In a war like so, people didn't get to choose if they had to fight or not, they had to fight, and it was best if they had every chance they could at evolving so they could survive. ... First up from the two of them was Vorden. ... He was currently an Emperor tier beast that could use the power of wind and had a fast agile body. ... As Vorden himself found out, the problem was that Emperor tier beasts were no match for the Dalki they were facing. ... At first, Quinn had done a simple test. ... He had selected an intermediate tier crystal and allowed for Vorden's body to absorb it. ... When using the inspect skill Quinn could see that his evolution percentage had gone up by one percent. ... Selecting another intermediate tier crystal, Raten was asked to do the same. ... \"Come on! ... Wouldn't it be better to just have me evolve? ... \" Raten complained. ... \"Surely one Demon tier beast would be better than having a legendary tier beast. ... \"It was safe to say that Raten was looking forward to his evolution and what his new body's powers could bring him. ... After absorbing the one crystal, Quinn could see that Raten's evolution had only improved by 0.02 percent. ... \"You won't evolve,\" Quinn said. ... \"Even if we were to give all the crystals to you, you wouldn't evolve. ... It looks like it's going to take a lot to evolve you Raten. ... \"Raten looked disappointed by the answer, but he didn't think Quinn was lying. ... He hoped that even Quinn would know they needed a Demon tier beast more than anything after going up against the five spiked Dalki. ... After absorbing close to two hundred crystals, Borden's body was going through the stages of evolution. ... His body was taking some time to take in the energy inside him. ... Eventually, a bright white light was shining from his body. ... The outline of it could be seen slowly changing. ... His black fur on his head started to grow even longer, now reaching below his waist, While the hair on his tails would rise up even more. ... Another strange change was his arms. ... The fur was coming out more so from it, nearly imitating tiny wings, and if one was to move the flowing hair going along his back, they could see the same. ... Finally, the evolution was complete. ... Vorden was now at the legendary tier level. ... \"What type of beast are you? ... \" Pai wondered as he got closer to looking at the details. ... \"At first, because of the black fur and your forward like face, I thought you were some type of black wolf beast, but from your arms and small wings on your back. ... It looks like if you keep evolving, you're going to like some type of bird beast. ... \"\"It's stupid to try and compare beasts from other planets to the animals we have on earth,\" Vicky commented, pointing out the obvious. ... \"I don't know when I will be able to get our hands on crystals like that again. ... Especially with the situation as it is. ... \" Quinn said. ... \"So maybe this will be the level you are at for a while. ... \"\"I can only say thank you, Quinn. ... I know what the situation is like. ... \" Vorden replied. ... Since Quinn realised that the reminding crystal wouldn't evolve Vorden to the next stage again, they decided to use the rest on Raten. ... If they didn't, they could just see Raten complaining the whole way. ... In the end, after absorbing all of the crystals, Raten was now 60.42 percent on his way to becoming a Demon tier beast. ... \"You know, speaking of crystals. ... Hilston had a bunch that he never used, that were all aboard that ship of his. ... \" Vicky said. ... \"After he got the Demon tier set, he wouldn't accept anything less than that. ... So crystals would hardly be used. ... Although I'm guessing the ship is either in the hands of the Chained or Mother and father have it by now. ... \"After saying the words mother and father, Vicky bit her tongue. ... She was trying to get out of the habit of saying those words, but after years of keeping up an act, the habit wouldn't be broken overnight. ... \"Quinn, what are you planning for us to do now? ... \" Vorden asked. ... \"I mean, when the Cursed ship is repaired, do you want us to protect the Cursed planets? ... \"\"No,\" Quinn replied. ... \"I think if we send any strong reinforcements, the Dalki might think we're prepping something and act out before then. ... At the moment, Sam is asking for small teams to be sent out to the three Cursed planets we have control of and setting up teleporters. ... The Dalki don't know our teleporters are back online, so we can go and help them out whenever we want. ... \"\"What are you going to do? ... \" Sil asked. ... Quinn held the Demon amulet around his neck and thought back to his defeat in the Dalki body against Graham. ... \"I'm thinking of going to some of the planets that have been taken over.... ... Alone. ... \" Quinn answered. ... \"The Demon tier amulet was made into something special, and I can use its powers to help us out the next time something like this happens again. ... So tell me then, why did you ask, what do you want to do? ... \"It was clear there was something on their mind, and Quinn could tell they wanted to ask something. ... \"Well, we were talking about it, but we wanted to head back to Blade island for a while. ... There are strong beasts on the island that Raten and I can use to evolve, and we also want to find any hints we can to find the other two Blade members that escaped. ... At the same time, Vicky and Pai wanted to use it as a base to get back to while they search for the Chained. ... \"At the moment, Eno and Mona were heading towards Balde island to reinforce it. ... At the same time, Dennis had gone along with them since he too had the shadow powers so Quinn could quickly travel there. ... He would also set up the teleporters so the world leaders and Quinn could get there at any time possible. ... \"I'm not going to stop you guys, you guys are strong, and I can tell you your family history is important to you guys,\" Quinn answered. ... \"But I just want you guys to be cautious. ... Eno, the demon tier beast, are on that island, and there is a high chance that it's the next place they will attack, but if they do, I will be there. ... \"Vorden felt a little guilty about not telling Quinn the whole truth, as there was one more reason why he wanted to go there. ... It was to see if they could find anything on the fact that Hilston was trying to accomplish a Blade with a soul weapon. ... There had to be a method to his madness and something they might have missed. ... This wasn't something Quinn needed to concern himself with. ... \"Quinn, if you need any help, you can ask us as well,\" Sil said with a smile. ... He seemed to be recovering well after the fight and everything to do with Hilston. ... It was a good thing that Vorden and Raten were by his side, and even more of the Blade's with Vicky and Pai. ... They were able to just fill the family gap that Quinn couldn't. ... Leaving them be, Quinn had one word to say to them all. ... \"You guys, make a good family and one hell of a scary one. ... \" Quinn smiled, leaving the room. ... Using the Demon tier amulet to obtain more Dalki and create higher spiked Dalki was Quinn's goal. ... At the same time, he could use their exp to level up. ... Before he could go off the planet Caladi, he needed to wait for the preparation of the video that was to be made. ... It was a broadcast to congratulate the Cursed faction while showing them giving the Demon tier weapon they had found. ... So before that, he couldn't leave the base, but there was still one more thing he wanted to do anyway. ... Heading to his own training room, Sam had said there was a nice surprise for him when he got there. ... Entering the pin on the secure door, he was let in, and Quinn could see five different flasks laying there on the ground. ... The flasks that were used to hold vampire blood.'Did he borrow the flasks from the others? ... I guess I'm going to have to give them back.'Opening up the lid and using the inspect skill, Quinn could immediately tell all the different types of blood in the flask gathered. ... Drops from hundreds of people in each of the flasks from all those in the Shelter. ... From the people, he had never consumed blood from before.'My Qi right now is stronger than my blood power. ... It was a problem before, but it can help me suppress the blood addiction more so. ... So I can take more drops of blood at a time. ... My control has gotten better, so this shouldn't be a problem.'Taking the first flask, Quinn started to drink it and got to work straight away. ... He could feel the red energy spiralling inside his body, but with how much practice he had done with his Qi, and his blood control having improved. ... It was almost too easy for him to get rid of the blood addiction. ... What was difficult in the past was now simply effortless, and with the stat points gained, Quinn had a massive smile on his face as he figured out something.'Wait a second, what is this! ... Why didn't I think of this before? ... Maybe the penalty was a blessing in disguise. ... Perhaps this is a chance for me to correct my stats!' Quinn thought as he went on to the next flask, and he could feel his body getting stronger by the second.******\n",

      "Although it was easy for Quinn to remove the effects of the Blood addiction, it still took some time for him to complete the process for each flask. ... While doing so, he was thinking about the best way he could allocate his stats. ... Most people's blood type in the world generally had the O blood type. ... The good thing was that this particular blood type would give Quinn a free stat to use as he wished. ... Different blood types after consuming so many of the same blood type, would give him a stat in a specific area.'Before every time I would level up, I would try to get my stats as even as possible. ... I thought being fast was just as important as being strong, and having the stamina to keep on fighting was as important as strength. ... However, after getting the legendary beast gear, things changed a bit. ... 'The stats gained from the set focused mainly on speed. ... Adding a few stats to my base points here and there isn't really going to affect my speed much. ... I thought my strength was strong enough, but not enough to pierce the skin of a five spike. ... This time I know where to put the stat points.'The penalty of course, still had affected Quinn. ... He had five fewer stats in every category, and if he was to do this, he still would have five more, but learning from the fight, he would now focus on putting his free stat points into strength. ... In the end, after drinking the blood from all the five flasks, Quinn in a way, was actually at a stage where he was stronger than before the penalty.[Strength 83][agility 72][Stamina 72][Charm 55]Quinn realised that each flask had continued roughly the same amount of different blood in each of them. ... However, he would get fewer stat points from each one, as obtaining stats from blood was getting harder and harder. ... His strength had been boosted beyond what it was before, while his agility and stamina were a little under what he had in the past. ... Hardly noticeable. ... The only stat that Quinn didn't bother to increase was his charm stat. ... In the past, he had gotten it up to the sixty mark, but with the opponents, he was fighting and the position he was in, there really was no need for him to use the influence power to such a degree anymore. ... The only way to also obtain a charm point was through a free stat by consuming the O blood type, and strength was a priority.'This is amazing. ... Maybe I should start going to the Cursed factions and ask Helen and the others to do the same when I arrive. ... I'm sure they would understand, right?' Quinn thought.'It might cause some worry. ... \" Vincent said. ... 'I'm not saying that it will, but in the past, a long time ago, history states that there was a time that some vampires and humans tried to live together by doing such things, but it never worked out. ... Perhaps it will be different with you because you only require a drop of their blood and only once. ... 'Although I'm sure questions will arise with what you are doing with that blood between them. ... At the same time, your stats are properly close to their limit if I was to guess. ... Just like in the past with the previous evolutions, your stats stopped growing at a point.'Taking Vincent's word, Quinn thought he might be right. ... Would it be worth maybe upsetting this in the Cursed faction for a few extra stat points?'Still, it's got to be better than death. ... Maybe I should just ask Helen to prepare it beforehand. ... It still takes a few hours for me to go through the process and get rid of the effects of the blood addiction.'Speaking of a few hours, Quinn just realised how long he had spent in his personal training room and was sure that the others would be ready for filming any second now.ââThe filming was to take place in the main Cursed ship hall, which had been cleaned up and down, scrubbed until it was sparkling. ... Decorations even filled the halls, with flowers and paintings Quinn had never seen aboard the ship before. ... Quinn was surprised at how much they had done while he was away. ... Sniffing the air a few times, Quinn could still smell it though. ... \"They can clean the room, but they can't exactly get rid of the smell of blood that easily, can they? ... \" Fex said, coming up from behind. ... Fex wasn't the only one in the main hall. ... A lot of the Cursed faction members had been invited inside the Cursed ship main hall. ... It was getting quite packed. ... \"I thought this whole thing was just going to be a quick video. ... \" Quinn looked at the crowds of people and excitement on their faces. ... There was even a stage that had been built. ... It reminded Quinn of the other ceremonies he had attended, such as the crowing of the vampire king. ... \"Apparently, Bonny said it will look more like an award ceremony with more people inside. ... It's got to look good for the public, ya know. ... \" Fex patted him a few times. ... On the stage, Sach was standing there along with others, and it looked like they were going through a dress rehearsal. ... By his side was a holographic display of Samantha. ... Quinn would be 'giving' the sword to Samantha while actually handing it to Sach on stage. ... \"Hey, how was she? ... \" Fex asked. ... Quinn was wondering who he was talking about, and followed where Fex's eyes were looking. ... He could see he was staring at Samantha. ... \"Oh, you're actually worried about her. ... That's a surprise? ... I didn't think she would exactly be your type. ... Isn't she a lot older than you as well? ... \" Quinn questioned. ... \"24, there's only around a 6 year difference, some people I know have hundreds of years of difference, and it still doesn't matter,\" Fex replied. ... Quinn often forgot that Fex actually came from a different world. ... Although they were of a similar age, what was ordinary to him and ordinary to others was just two different things. ... \"Honestly, she seemed determined.. ... but also something was still a little off,\" Quinn remembered back at the meeting. ... Although she had allowed them to have the sword, it didn't seem like it was because she wanted the Cursed faction to have it, but because she was undeserving of it. ... \"I think she could do with someone by her side,\" Quinn said. ... \"If you can hit it at the right moment and actually talk to her like you care about her, unlike all those other girls you talk to, maybe you two can hit it off. ... \"\"Hey, the day I start taking love advice from you will be the day you become the vampire king. ... \" Fex jokingly replied, thinking that both things were doubtful.ââ-Before the filming began, Quinn was instructed by Sam on everything that needed to be done. ... The main people that needed to be seen on camera were up on the makeshift stage, and the crowd watching were told when to cheer and clap. ... It was different compared to when Quinn was being filmed before, but at the same time, there was less pressure on himself. ... This was because unlike all the other times he was on camera in the past, this was not going to be live. ... Bonny told Quinn that he could relax, and they could edit out whatever they needed to. ... After filming for a short while, Void and bonny could be seen conversing with each other. ... \"He wasn't in the rehearsal, was he? ... \" Void asked. ... \"No, he just came now, and Sam told him everything that needed to be said. ... We have been able to do nearly everything in one take. ... \" Bonny replied. ... \"Well, I was checking out the script that we gave to him as a guideline. ... I didn't expect him to, but he's been able to repeat the words exactly as they were written one by one. ... If what you are saying is true, he must have an incredible memory and be a really quick learner. ... \" Hearing this, Bonny looked at Quinn and remembered the words that he, or at least someone, had said to her as she left. ... That she should give up on him. ... 'Who could give up on someone like him.' Bonny thought. ... The Demon tier weapon being used was the real one, and the handling of the Demon tier sword was done so to Sach. ... Soon after, Samantha gave a speech about how thankful she was. ... Then it was Quinn's turn. ... Walking up to the stage, he was meant to say a few words about Oscar, but a message sounded in his head just as he did.'This is an important message, being sent out to all those in the Tenth family. ... A council meeting has been requested. ... I repeat a council meeting has been requested. ... Please come to the meeting or send a proxy in your place.'The message was sent through telepathy, and looking out in the crowd, Quinn could tell that Fex had received the news as well. ... The voice was familiar, and without a doubt, it was from Jil.'A message from the vampire world, and to come back? ... What is going on?' Quinn thought. ... ******Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "The audience below continued to look at Quinn as he stood there speechless, unaware of the message that he had just received. ... It was only when he noticed Bonny and Void each giving him a pensive look that he remembered that he was about to give a speech. ... Putting the content of the message to the back of his mind, Quinn finished the whole recording speaking his lines, like a professional actor would have, but as soon as the whole show was over, he disappeared to the side, followed by Fex. ... \"Did you receive the order to head back to attend a council meeting as well? ... \" Fex asked to make sure. ... \"Yeah, and their timing could hardly be any worse. ... The planets are still under the attack of the Dalki and they won't just stop if we're gone. ... I have a feeling that it might be Arthur. ... \" Quinn shared his own thoughts on the matter. ... Soon, all of the Cursed leaders could see the concerned look on Quinn's face as he walked off to the command centre. ... They knew something was up and started to follow after him, waiting for him to tell them the reason for this sudden change. ... \"Sach, I'm sorry, but it seems like something has come up. ... I'm sure you can take the rest from here. ... You have been a big help to us and we'll let you know if we encounter any other problems. ... \" Sam said with a nod and the Supreme Commander understood not to ask any questions. ... Although a message hadn't been sent out to him, the connection inside him had flicked for a second, almost resonating with Quinn's worry. ... Judging by the confused looks on the others' faces it seemed like the only ones who had actually received the message had just been Quinn and Fex. ... Either Jil lacked a way of communicating with the others, or only those two were regarded as true vampires among the Cursed Faction. ... Whatever the case, Quinn quickly told them about the order. ... \"So they want you to go back, but they didn't tell you the reason? ... \" Sam asked after listening to Quinn's explanation. ... \"Council meetings between the leaders used to be a rare thing, since the leaders could deal with their own vampires in their own families. ... \" Fex started to explain. ... \"It was only later when Quinn and the worry of the Punishers was causing a ruckus that the Council would have regular meetings. ... If the Council is meeting up again, I can only imagine it is something serious. ... \"But Quinn there was something strange about the message. ... It said that you could send a proxy in your place. ... Do you think Bryce did that out of consideration knowing that you might be busy? ... Or do you think he just doesn't want you to come? ... \"'Could this be an important enough matter to inform me that there was a meeting but at the same time he doesn't want me to be present? ... But if that's true, why even inform me in the first place?''I'm not sure how much the other vampires know about Arthur's Involvement with Jim and the Dalki. ... Maybe he's worried that me and Arthur are still close because we worked together in the past?' Quinn wondered. ... \"I.. ... I don't think it's a good idea for you to go. ... \" Layla spoke up. ... \"Whenever we go to that place there always seems to be a problem that you end up getting dragged into. ... If it happens again, then that means if the Cursed faction or the others find themselves in trouble we won't be able to help them! ... \"\"Still, you have to keep in mind that no matter what, at some point the vampires will get involved in all of this. ... \" Sam added. ... \"There's no way around it, not with the other half of the Demon tier beast in their possession. ... The Dalki may be focusing on the one on Earth, but at some point they will go for one in the Vampire World as well. ... \"Both of them made good points, and the group started to discuss amongst themselves what the best course of action would be. ... Given Quinn's Shadow travel he could quickly get out if needed, but that would mean he would have to go alone, something the others weren't too keen on. ... After all, nearly all of them were now involved in the Vampire World, they too were considered vampires! ... \"Let's contact Paul first. ... Maybe he has an idea why this meeting has been called. ... \" Quinn suggested. ... \"Without knowing anything about the importance of the meeting, we might just be making a big deal out of nothing. ... \"The call was being made to the other side and everyone was nervous as they could hear it ringing a few times. ... It not being answered right away was a sign that something serious must have happened, yet Quinn wasn't too worried, for he had neither gotten a message nor a Quest from the System about anything happening to the tenth or fourteenth castle. ... \"I was expecting a call from you at some point, but it came earlier than I thought. ... \" A voice eventually answered from the other end. ... Hearing that Paul was the one that answered, all of them felt relieved. ... \"We just received information about a council meeting, I'm sure you have been reading the reports I have been sending out from here. ... \" Sam said. ... Sam thought it was important that Paul also knew the situation in the human world. ... From time to time, Sam would also contact Paul asking him for advice on what tactics to use or implement. ... After all, Paul had more experience when it came to these types of things. ... \"Yes I have, so I understand you're in a tricky situation. ... Let me get straight to the point then. ... The other day, the third leader was murdered. ... At the moment, there is no known suspect, but that has to be the reason for the meeting. ... \"\"Does it have anything to do with Arthur? ... \" Quinn asked immediately before anyone else could say anything. ... \"Quinn, I fully know the situation over on your and our end. ... At the moment, there has been no signs of Arthur being involved. ... The way it happened, I'm not sure if it is something he would do, but the panic in place... ... From my point of view it appears that whoever killed the vampire leader, did so to create fear in the vampire community. ... If you wish, I can handle it, and I promise to inform you when it gets too much. ... \" Paul replied. ... Honestly, there were more than a few reasons why Quinn didn't want to return to the Vampire World just yet. ... If Arthur was really on the other side, what could he even do to stop him? ... As a Vampire Lord he had been unable to do much against a weakened Slicer on his own, so what chance would he stand against the original Punisher? ... On top of that, there were still the Dalki Quinn wanted to mark to give him a boost whenever possible. ... Lastly, the Cursed faction leader hadn't really gotten any closer to Paul's own request about turning his men human again. ... Paul was doing a good job, and it seemed like he was taking things seriously. ... Quinn was aware that his Vampire Knight wouldn't blame him for not finding a way replicate something that only Vincent had succeeded in, in such a short time, but Quinn wanted to reward his diligence, feeling a little embarrassed that he had nothing to show for his time away.'Quinn, I agree with you. ... Now isn't a good time for you to return. ... It would halt all the progress we are making here at the moment. ... Besides, you could find yourself in the middle of a fight between Arthur and Bryce.' Vincent said. ... \"Paul, I will leave things to you then! ... \"All the odd jobs that needed to be done had finally finished on Planet Caladi. ... Some of those that were in the Cursed faction had decided to stay on the planet, believing it was safer, while others decided to leave on the ship again now that repairs were done. ... The idea was the Cursed faction would try to send support where it could not stay in one sector too long. ... The good news was that the teleporters that they had tested so far were a success so in reality they had a plan to support the Cursed faction and Helen whenever it was needed. ... Aware about what was happening in the Vampire World, Quinn was more determined than ever before to get to work as quickly as possible. ... He left on a ship to the planets in the Earthborn group, hoping to fight some Dalki gaining exp and catching more Marked. ... He chose those planets, to avoid meeting Graham again. ... After landing on one, it didn't take long for Quinn to use the amulet powers obtaining his first Dalki again.'Your power will become my power.' Quinn thought, looking at the one spike. ... 'So I need you and the rest to grow as strong as you can as quickly as possible.'Meanwhile, Graham himself had actually decided to move out of the Cursed faction planet area. ... Currently, he was in the Graylash faction, inside one of the Dalki motherships. ... \"The plan so far has proceeded splendidly. ... It's over a bit quicker than we expected and now the humans are on the defensive. ... Now all we need to do is decide which one to attack first, I hope you won't fail this time? ... \" Turning around, Graham was looking at another green liquid filled container, and inside it was a Dalki that was heavily wounded. ... It had slashes across its body, broken bones on the outside and ripped scales all over. ... It was clear the markings were not done by a human and looked more like one done by a Dalki. ... \"They got rid of a single five spiked Dalki and look how much they are celebrating. ... Well I wonder how they will feel once they see you. ... Don't fail us for a third time, Green Horn, otherwise I will have to deal with it again myself. ... \" Graham said as the machine was activated and soon the Dalki's body was starting to heal.******\n",

      "Although Vicky and Pai had said they would be journeying around the beast solar system to catch the dangerous Chained that had escaped. ... They had decided to travel with the rest of the Blade family, heading towards Blade island. ... Vicky and Pai needed a place to start and somewhere they could frequent back to. ... Although they were strong, the Dalki were still out there, and everyone had seen their faces on camera by now. ... They were no longer the Unknown Blade family, so the places they could stay without causing too much trouble were practically none. ... Heading to the Blade island also meant the group would be heading back to Earth. ... Currently, all of the Blades were on a ship heading through the teleport station. ... All apart from the Blade children, they had remained on the ship. ... They would have liked to come but were told they were not allowed. ... It was a dangerous place, and possibly the centre of the next fight would be there. ... Usually, the giant teleport station for ships was offline during these times of war. ... The station needed great power to be turned on again and would take some time. ... However, because Eno and Mona were heading back to Earth anyway, they were able to travel through it shortly after them. ... After that, the station would be closed once again. ... For fear, the Dalki could use it in some way. ... However, since the Dalki named Dred had appeared on Earth, and the fact that the V were able to hide amongst humans, they knew there was already a way for the enemy to arrive on Earth despite this. ... The ship approached Earth with relative ease. ... The military that was in charge of protecting Earth knew they would be arriving. ... Still, at the same time, there was far more security compared to the times before. ... It had to be due to the warning given by Eno. ... Sach had gotten to work quickly. ... Flying outwards to the island, they could see it off in the distance. ... It was a place they once all called home. ... Yet, it felt like hell for them all. ... Seeing it was brewing some odd feelings for them all. ... Sil, Raten, Vorden, Vicky, Pai and finally another who had come along with them all, Borden. ... He was the only one that didn't have this strange feeling in his stomach. ... Mona, Eno, Brock and Dennis had already set up base on top of the large Castle on the island itself. ... It wasn't too far from the giant tablet. ... Even on top of the Castle, one could look out and see the tablet as well as the Demon tier beast that was still resting. ... \"That's those Blade kid's Sam talked to us about, right? ... \" Mona said, looking at the ship land in the large open space by the giant staircase leading up to the Castle. ... \"Yeah, he said that they would be doing their own thing. ... We don't have to worry about them. ... Remember, they were originally raised on this island, so whatever beast they run into, they can take them on. ... \" Dennis replied as he carried a large metallic object on his back. ... \"Now, tell me, where do you want this thing? ... \" Dennis asked. ... \"The teleporter will need to be put in a safe place,\" Eno said while he was looking down. ... \"We could either place it by the tablet or inside the Castle. ... I'm struggling to decide what the safe option would be. ... \"\"Oh. ... \" Mona was surprised. ... \"I thought you were someone who had everything figured out. ... I'm surprised to hear you're struggling with a simple decision like this. ... \" Walking over to the edge, she went to look at what Eno had been staring at for so long. ... That's when her eyes could see what he was now looking at as well. ... \"Now you see my struggle. ... I'm pretty sure that wasn't there the last time I came here. ... \" Eno replied. ... Exiting the ship, the group of Blades decided to walk up the long staircase together. ... Step after step, they did so slowly. ... Not a single one of them was running up the stairs in excitement at all. ... \"Come on guys, you are really slow. ... Do you need me to pick you up? ... \" Borden said as he jumped up to the next step. ... He was no longer in his full human form compared to before, so now he was as small as a puppy climbing the stairs. ... Vicky, watching this, couldn't help but stare in fascination and thought the whole thing was a little cute.'This little guy was the same guy that was threatening us?' Pai thought. ... \"Hey, why don't you just stay on my shoulder for the rest of the way,\" Vorden asked. ... \"You don't have to tire yourself out. ... \"\"I'm not tired, and you know I like to do things for myself. ... Besides, you guys are clearly worrying about other things. ... That Hilston guy you were all scared of is gone! ... So I don't know why you are all acting like he's still alive. ... This place used to belong to him, well now it's all yours. ... \" Borden shouted back as he continued to hop up the stairs, getting ahead of everyone else. ... \"Damn it, how can that little runt be so right! ... I can't believe I was feeling this way and hanging around with the loser bunch. ... \" Raten said as he ran ahead, catching up with Borden. ... For the others, they looked at each other and smiled. ... Borden's words had picked them up a little. ... It was just so hard to believe that Hilston was gone. ... Any second, when they opened those doors, they were expecting to see Hilston on the other side. ... When the others had finally reached the stairs, they could see the doors wide open, but there was no 'Family' that was there to greet them like there usually would be. ... The inside of the place was empty, feeling emptier than usual. ... \"We came here last time, but we were unable to find anything other than a journal,\" Sil said. ... \"Quinn has the journal at the moment, but other than all the ability users in that journal, it didn't seem to have anything else inside. ... Do you think we'll find anything this time? ... \"The reason they had come here was to perhaps learn what exactly Hilston was planning if he really was looking for a Blade with a soul weapon and why. ... \"Last time, you didn't have Pai and me. ... \" Vicky proudly said, walking in front taking the lead. ... \"You have to remember, we left with Hilston when he decided to go after you guys, and you three were young, so they didn't exactly show you all the places in this Castle. ... What do you think is under the giant staircases in the first place? ... \"Thinking about it, although the Castle was on a type of Hill, the staircase and Castle seemed to be at a higher level than others. ... It was starting to make Vorden wonder, by Vicky's words, if they were man-made. ... With a strong Earth ability, one could landscape the whole area to their liking.'Is there something underneath the castle?' Vorden thought. ... Following Vicky, she had eventually led them to one of the training rooms they all remembered well. ... Above reinforce glass could be seen. ... When looking, Vorden had memories of the tests he had been put through. ... At the time, they were unaware that Raten and Vorden were in Sil's mind and were trying to force Sil to use his six abilities again. ... So he fought against a dangerous beast in this chamber, hoping to draw out his power. ... Vorden could see a younger version of himself in Sil's body fighting for his life. ... \"Sil, although you had the power to wield six abilities, your body never did quite go through the change that Hilston wanted for you, unlike the rest of us. ... We were able to achieve superhuman bodies, but you weren't. ... We all saw Hilston losing to that five spike. ... I'm not telling you to continue that training again now. ... Still, if you are going to go up against the Dalki again, maybe it would be a good idea to practice in this room from time to time. ... \" Vicky suggested. ... Hearing this, Sil thought they were right. ... Sil knew that if he was to fight Hilston head on, or Slicer that he wouldn't have survived, which was why he had taken advantage of the situation in the first place. ... However, thinking about training in this place again made him think of the temple and every bad thought that came with it. ... \"We can do that somewhere else,\" Vorden said. ... \"It doesn't need to be in this place. ... We are just here to find out more about Hilston and get some crystals. ... \"Turning around, Vicky headed to the centre of the training room. ... \"You know, you can't keep protecting him like that. ... It's because of you two in the first place protecting him that he hasn't been able to grow. ... Pai had pressed some buttons on the monitoring machinery by the side of the room, and a steam-like substance started to appear out from the centre of the room. ... Then a circular platform could be seen. ... The group walked on the platform, and soon it started to sink into the ground like an elevator. ... The first things they could hear were the cries and shouts of beasts. ... \"Where is this place taking us? ... \" Vorden asked. ... Worried that they were heading into a trap, but what reason could Pai and Vicky have for doing that now? ... \"Don't worry. ... It's a separate storage place that Hilston used and was where the strong beast you used to fight with when you were younger were kept. ... Honestly, without being fed, I'm not sure how they were able to stay alive this long. ... \"When the evaluator finally stopped, the door opened, and two people could be seen standing in front of them. ... Immediately all of them were ready for a fight. ... \"Mother! ... Father! ... \" Vicky shouted.******\n",

      "NOTE: My Werewolf system is now out on Webnovel. ... Search for it on web novel******Looking around at their situation, Vorden was trying to figure out what was going on. ... Whether their group had been led into a trap and now Vicky and Pai would be turning on them with their mother and father. ... With the four of them, it would be a difficult fight for them to get out of. ... However, judging by Vicky and Pai's quick reaction and genuine look of shock on thier face, it seemed like they had no idea what they were doing down here either. ... Because of this, the instincts in their bodies had fired up and were telling them to fight. ... Vicky was the one who acted first, throwing out a punch. ... It was soon not only blocked by her mother but also for it to swiftly be knocked away. ... After, she pulled her arm and put Vicky in a type of lock around her neck so she wouldn't be getting away. ... Pai, seeing her sister in trouble, also quickly went in to help. ... Still, before he could do anything, he felt a kick to his knee and his upper body falling before he was grabbed and turned around, being held from behind with both of his arms held back. ... He tried to kick behind him, but they were hitting nothing but air.'His strength, he's so much stronger than me.' Pai thought, attempting to break free. ... If a normal civilian who had seen the video of the Blades fighting had seen this, they would be wondering just what was going on. ... Neither side had used a single ability. ... Surely in such a situation, they would have used one. ... The reason was simple, they had no ability to use, because of the amount of time that had passed. ... The Blades hadn't brought any ability users with them, so they had no powers to share. ... In the first place, they didn't want to drag anyone who was uninvolved in the matter. ... It also felt strange to carry an ability user with them just to use their power. ... It was a disgusting feeling, and it reminded them of the Chained, which in turn made them think of Hilston. ... This was why Pai and Vicky were unable to use their powers. ... It turned out, it was the same for their parents, who had been in the castle for an unknown amount of time. ... Even though all four of them had super bodies, they lost out in skill and power when it came to their older parents. ... Regardless of their situation, both Vicky and Pai had a smile on their face because they weren't panicked at all. ... For there were those with them that didn't need to use any abilities at all, and even when they had thier abilities, they had put up a good fight against them. ... \"Let go of them you two! ... \" Vorden shouted. ... Their father made sure to point their bodies in the direction of the beasts in front of them, using them as types of shields. ... \"If we do, then it will leave room for you to attack us. ... If you take one step closer, we will finish them. ... We have the strength to do so. ... \" The father said. ... \"Do you think I care! ... \" Raten screamed, charging forward. ... Vorden wanted to hold him back, unsure if their threat was real, but it was too late. ... The speed of the Demi-god tier beast was great, and Raten was directly behind the two of them, with two mud blades pointed towards their back. ... \"Stop! ... \" Sil shouted, and the mud blades had stopped before they pierced their flesh.'Damn it, my body listens to Sil. ... All those years spent being in his head, it was like my mind acted on reflex.' Raten was complaining and ready to attack again, but by then, both parents had let go of Vicky and Pai. ... \"I can tell. ... They don't want to hurt us. ... They're just like us. ... There is no reason for us to fight. ... \" When Sil had said these words, everyone there realised it was true. ... For some reason, they all thought they were against each other when their eyes met. ... It was either them or us mentality, but was that really the case? ... Even the parents hesitated whether it was right to attack or not, but started to defend themselves when they saw the others coming towards them. ... \"We didn't come here to fight. ... \" The male Balde said of the two. ... \"We didn't even expect any of you to be here. ... Please let's just talk things through. ... Remember, we too wanted to let go of this dreaded life. ... \"The fact that all of them had experienced the same thing, and the cause of all their problems was one person, it felt like they could tell when and if the other person was telling the truth or not and at the moment, they felt like they were.'Seriously, one family member caused this much trouble for all of them. ... Just what did Hilston Blade do to them all.' Borden thought, as the group now were accompanied by two more members of the Blade family. ... Instead of calling them father and mother, they had introduced their given names to the rest of the group. ... The mother Blade, went by the name Tina, while the father was named Kane. ... It turned out that the reason for being in such a place was to pick up a few items from the storage room. ... \"There are a lot of items in this place that weren't good enough for Hilston, but we left them down here, of course. ... \"The group was currently walking through a dark tunnel, lit lightly from small embedded light crystals in the ground. ... However, they didn't provide much light at all for the group. ... The Darkness made it hard to see and was adding to the spookiness of the place. ... What would have been even more heart-pounding for some was the sounds that they could hear throughout. ... The snarling and banging noises that would ring through the tunnels. ... The ground was flat and well made but seemed like it was done using an ability. ... Since it was made from the same material as the ground itself, rather than some type of metal. ... Where this was different was the side of the walls. ... There were metal bars similar to a prison cell, but they weren't ordinary cells or bars. ... These were around ten meters in height, from the ground to the ceiling, and the bars were made from Glathrium. ... Looking through one of the cages, Borden could just see glowing eyes staring back at him. ... Still, when Raten looked at several of them, they could be seen backing away and going silent awfully quick. ... \"Haha, look at those weaklings. ... \" Raten laughed. ... \"They're scared of me, aren't they? ... Just wait until I get your crystals and grow even stronger. ... \"Of course, those in the cages were beasts of high tiers, but Raten himself was a beast that was even higher than them, and they could sense that. ... They weren't willing to anger the beast at the cost of their lives. ... \"When we heard the elevator activating, we knew someone was coming down here, so we went to take a look, but we just never expected it to be you guys,\" Kane said. ... \"How, how did you get here, aren't there others that are meant to be protecting this place,\" Vorden asked. ... \"Brock let us in,\" Tina replied. ... \"You know we have a good relationship with him. ... \"Vorden thought it would have been nice for Brock to at least meet them and inform them that there were other Blades on the island or in the castle. ... He must have known how sensitive the situation would have been between them all. ... Finally, the group had reached the storage room. ... There was no door or anything of the sort for protection. ... Like most things on Blade island. ... Because no one would even think of betraying Hilston while being on the island. ... It was just one large empty circular room filled with Crystals and beast equipment that had been forged. ... Piled on top of each other as if they had no importance. ... The things in the room would have caused factions to have wars over. ... They could even see the armour that had been given to the other Blade's who worked on the island here or used to work here. ... \"Well, this doesn't really help us all that much apart from the crystals,\" Vorden said, having a look and feeling a little upset. ... In the past, while having a human body he would have been far more excited to have seen such items. ... \"You know, there are certain beast crystals that can be forged and work on Beasts as well. ... So I wouldn't be too upset. ... \" Tina said. ... The group started to search the room. ... While Tina and Kane stood by the side. ... They had already got what they wanted from the room, but that's when they noticed that none of them were happy with what they were finding, as if they were after something else. ... \"Nothing, there is nothing,\" Sil said, disappointed, kicking a piece of armour away. ... There was nothing about Hilston Blade, so what would they do now? ... Looking towards the two that were with them, now they were Sil's only hope. ... \"Did you not find what you were looking for? ... \" Tina asked. ... It certainly was a big haul for the group, and when they left the place, Vorden could inform Dennis of what they found. ... It could be put to good use for the war. ... \"Actually, we were looking for information about Hilston,\" Vorden said. ... \"If we couldn't find anything here, like we have done, the next thing we were actually going to do was ask you guys. ... \"Why did Hilston make us all pretend to be a family? ... Why was Hilston desperately searching for Sil and making so many... ... children! ... Why put us through all that! ... \" Vorden asked. ... The two of them stayed silent for a while until the answer had finally left their lips. ... \"This is probably what you didn't want to hear, but we don't actually know the answer,\" Kane replied. ... At that point, Sil, Vorden, Pai and even Vicky wanted to fall to their knees. ... Having come on this journey with them, their curiosity soon started to grow as well, but the last people that perhaps would have known an answer, didn't have one for them. ... \"They might not know, but I do. ... For I have been with Hilston, even longer than he has known himself. ... \" A voice said, entering the room. ... His face came into view, and they could see that it was none other than Brock. ... \"Do you really want to know everything there is to know about the Hilston Blade? ... \"******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "NOTE: My Werewolf system is now out on Webnovel. ... Search for it on web novel*****Seeing Brock standing there for some reason he didn't look too out of place with the rest of the Blades, despite the fact that he was actually a vampire, but then it hit Vorden. ... The reason he didn't look out of place was because Brock wasn't. ... Ever since Vorden had been in the family he had known Brock, for he had been the Head Butler of the entire castle. ... When the others had found out about him, Quinn had updated them on who Brock really was, how he had been working for Eno and through the years of working for the Blade family would constantly change his appearance. ... Since he had always been part of their life, none of them had ever asked themselves the question about just how far back Brock's history with the Blade family actually dated?'It would make sense that Brock started to follow the Blade family after they had settled on the island or once the Demon tier beast came into play, but if he really knows that much about the Hilston Blade's past, could it be possible that he was following him even before that? ... But why?' Was the question running through Vorden's mind? ... Of course, Kane, Tina, Vicky and Pai were left quite confused as to why the Head Butler would know more about the Blade family than themselves. ... \"I want to know, Brock please if you can, tell us! ... \" Sil requested. ... Sil didn't care why Brock knew, he just wanted answers. ... \"Then let me start from the beginning of Hilston Blade's life. ... He might not have looked like it, but he has lived for far more years than any of you might imagine. ... He has long since gone beyond the limit of a regular human, in more than just one sense. ... \" Brock started to explain, but even his first words were confusing for the Blade family. ... What did he mean by this? ... The only beings able to outlive normal humans they knew of were vampires, but Hilston had never shown any signs of being a vampire whatsoever. ... The more they heard the more questions they started to have, but Brock's demeanor made it clear that he wasn't about to stop until he finished answering Sil's request. ... \"When I start my story, the beginning of this tale might sound awfully familiar to some of you. ... For you see, Hilston grew up without any family. ... As an orphan, he had been unaware of any other living relatives and during the time period he had been born into, it had been nearly impossible to trace back or find out who his true family were. ... \"\"Growing up, he had been bullied by those around him that were of a similar age, and he had no support whatsoever. ... The only thing he had been able to do was steal and fight to survive. ... However, as a small child there had been many others who had beaten him once they had caught him, stealing what little he had. ... \"\"This continued for nearly his entire childhood life until someone had come into his life, a stranger had decided to pick him up. ... His days of being beaten and bullied had suddenly been over. ... No longer had he been forced to steal or rummage through bins for stale food, able to enjoy his life for the first time. ... In fact, it was that person who had inspired him to take on his last name. ... \"\"After pampering and looking after Hilston for two years, he had kicked him out of the house. ... This had come as a shock to young Hilston, who had done no wrong. ... He had been ready to dedicate his life to the person who had gotten him off the street, wondering why the man had suddenly abandoned him? ... \"\"Hilston had begged and pleaded to at least get an explanation. ... After waiting in front of his benefactor's door for a week, the man had eventually opened the door, telling him a few simple words: 'Do you know why those other people kept on beating you? ... It was because you were weak. ... If you wish to return to my side, then become a Blade that I can use, one stronger than any other.'\"\"These words had sprouted in his head as he had received kindness for the first time since he could remember. ... Young Hilston had been unable to understand the meaning behind those words at first. ... No matter how many times he came back and pleaded to the man, he would beat him and leave him barely alive. ... \"\"One day, while following him, he found that the man had picked up another young boy. ... One that was similar in age, and was treating him with the same kindness that he had received. ... 'Why, Why does that boy deserve that man's kindness and not mine, is he stronger than me?' was Hilston's thought.'\"\"This was when Hilston started to go down the dark path, he wanted to prove to the man that he was stronger, and in doing so he had brought back the body of the boy that the man had looked after in his hands to his door. ... \"\"Usually people would be frightened by this fact, would have called the child a demon but instead. ... The man smiled and took in the boy encouraging his actions. ... Perhaps Hilston thought that would be the end of his troubles, but once again the pattern had repeated. ... Hilston was kicked out again and sent away, the process repeated itself with Hilston proving he was stronger than the others he was replaced with, until a boy who had been taken in his place, had an ability. ... \"\"Remember, abilities existed before the Dalki war. ... They were rare but people either kept them secret or taught them within their family line, but it seemed like even this boy was unaware and the man wanted to grow it once again. ... \"\"I could imagine the thoughts going through Hilston's head at this point, that he was weak, he needed to get stronger so the man, the only person who had accepted him, would take him in. ... Once again, Hilston set out to kill the new man's favourite boy, but with an ability how would he fare? ... \"\"It was only then that Hilston had discovered while fighting his opponent, that he too had an ability and it was the same as the boys. ... This was the start of the Blade family ability. ... One would think he could finally live in peace with the man as he had always wished for but instead he had become paranoid. ... \"\"He had already experienced being replaced by some stronger than himself and it was not a feeling he wished to relive. ... Hilston grew a strong body by training day and night with this fear, and even if he was to meet other ability users, his ability and body put together were strong enough to combat theirs. ... \"\"As he got older he no longer needed to rely on the man but stayed as a close acquaintance until he eventually had raised a family of his own. ... Eventually his wife blessed him with a beautiful child, a boy. ... The man that had taken Hilston in was treated by him like his father, and one day he had come over as a grandfather to play with the boy. ... Then at a certain age, Hilston's own son was known to have an ability, the same ability as himself, only it was slightly better than his. ... \"Listening to this part of the story, Vorden thought it was similar to all the Blades' today. ... Their powers varied in how many abilities they could carry. ... Still, he let Brock finish his story. ... \"The mysterious man frequently visited their household but instead of paying attention to Hilston he only had eyes for the boy. ... \"\"So many years had gone by with no problem whatsoever, that nobody realised that the true fear had struck in Hilston once again. ... 'What if that man was to stab me again?' He did what no father would have ever done, and just like many times in the past. ... Hilston had proved that he was the Blade that the man needed, not his son. ... \"\"You see from his Dark past I can only fill in the pieces of what else I know. ... The man and Hilston at some point separated, but his desire to please this person had never left. ... The Blade family ability has one crucial weakness, and that is the fact that it requires other abilities in order for its powers to be used. ... Otherwise it only lasts for twenty four hours. ... \"\"Coming to this realization Hilston became obsessed with growing stronger and he couldn't stand this one weakness. ... He believed that the answer was in the soul weapon. ... He had seen through his family the ability grow stronger. ... So perhaps there would eventually be one with a soul weapon that could cover for this weakness\"\"But why did this benefit him? ... Without realising it, through the years Hilston had been able to gather abilities that would slow down the aging process, heal his insides wounds and disease , and also was able to obtain a superhuman body where the cells aged at a slower rate, but even all of those things wouldn't explain how he had managed to live for so long. ... \"\"The answer, you two might already know for yourselves. ... \" Brock said, pointing towards Raten and Vorden. ... \"If you haven't guessed, he used the same ability that the boy Shiro has, and transferred his mind into theirs. ... Swapping bodies and killing his old self inside. ... Whenever he found someone stronger than himself this would repeat this pattern. ... So now you know the reason why Hilston was obsessed with getting Sil back. ... \"\"As for why he asked you all to be treated as a family I do not know the answer. ... Maybe it was because he never had a real family growing up. ... Or perhaps it was due to him trying to forget of the perfect family he had in the past that he himself had ruined. ... Perhaps running away from this all, but that is everything I know about Hilston Blade. ... \"The others were left speechless not knowing what to say. ... However, it left a lot for them to think about, in particular Vorden was struggling with the story that Brock told for a few reasons. ... How did Brock know so much detail about Hilston's past from when he was a child? ... The way he spoke about Hilston's thoughts were certainly strange and it sounded like it was more than just Brock's assumptions. ... Lastly, the scariest thing about the story was the mysterious man. ... The man who had turned Hilston into the monster he was today, it almost seemed as if his actions had been intentional. ... It was a scary thought that there might be a person out there who was more cruel and messed up than Hilston Blade. ... Vorden just hoped that this person was no longer alive.*******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "After witnessing what was out there from the top of the Castle, Eno, Mona and Dennis decided to head down and check out the tablet and Demon tier beast. ... As the one who had to transport the heavy portable teleporter, Dennis was lagging behind the other two. ... He had the strength to be faster without tiring out, but since he had been told that it was sensible equipment he was nervous about tripping on some root or such.'I just wanted to enjoy some quiet days with Megan, yet here I am stuck with people I don't really know. ... ... ... just gotta remind myself that I'm doing this for everyone and that includes Megan. ... If we don't do what needs to be done then the whole world will suffer.' The vampire thought to himself, elated that they were getting closer to their destination. ... As they went through the Castle, Brock who was originally with them decided to split off. ... There hadn't been any words exchanged between Eno and Brock which Dennis found a little weird, but decided to ignore it. ... He wondered what could be so strange that it had caught the attention of the other two, but before he had the chance to get a proper look at it, they were already back on the move. ... Finally they could see the large tablet. ... The loud snores coming from the Demon tier beast were frightening in itself. ... \"Hey, this beast, it really doesn't attack us right? ... \" Dennis asked in a low voice. ... \"I don't know, to be honest, I was passed out for the most part last time. ... \" Mona shrugged her shoulders. ... \"Apparently Quinn talked to the tablet or something and whatever's inside made it so the beast agreed not to attack us. ... Let's just hope our stay here won't disturb its slumber and it will recognise us even without Quinn by our side. ... \"That didn't sound very convincing, so Dennis decided to follow the others a few steps back, so he could get a head start if anything was to happen.'Should I just start setting up the teleport here and now so I can use it if the beast attacks us? ... The beast should be too large to get through the teleporter... ... right?' Dennis thought nervously. ... However, going up the slight hill, the pathway started to level out and that's when he could see what they had all been staring at. ... Dennis hadn't been part of the group last time, not that they had come to Blade Island for sight-seeing, but it was certainly eye catching. ... The ground was mostly flat and towards the back was a giant tablet that looked like a small mountain. ... Then off to the side of the tablet lay the Demon tier beast, but none of these things had caught Dennis' eyes or the others, it was what laid in the centre. ... A human sized tree with pink flowers. ... The pink colour radiated and when staring at it, Dennis felt like he was so at peace. ... \"That thing definitely wasn't there before. ... \" Mona said. ... \"Yes, and it resembles something that I have seen before elsewhere. ... \" The tree reminded Eno of the Demon tier beast that Quinn had ultimately defeated only smaller in size, but what was it doing here? ... Eno was the first to walk up to it, unafraid, yet he gave a hand signal for the others to stay back. ... If it really was a sapling of that Demon tier tree with the same abilities as the other one, there was a risk Mona and Dennis would be Marked, and Eno still had a use for them. ... He was confident in his own powers and skills to fight off such a Marking. ... Walking close to it there was no such reaction at all from the tree, making Eno wonder if it was even a beast at all. ... When he finally got within touching distance he quickly placed his hand on the tree.'This certainly is confusing? ... Is it a beast or is it not? ... It's almost as if the crystal in its body hasn't finished forming. ... These days I keep running into things that I am struggling to make a decision on. ... However, if it was a threat then I'm sure that the other Demon tier beast would have gotten rid of it. ... Maybe we can use this, and if it does evolve into a Demon tier beast that would be another great thing to have.' Eno thought. ... \"Okay I've decided, place the portal near the tablet. ... The Demon tier beast is protecting the tablet, so I don't think it will let it come to any harm. ... \" Eno turned around to address the other two. ... \"The castle is a standout landmark, so they might go for it first. ... Not that the tablet isn't but I'm sure the tablet will be kept in good condition. ... \"Listening to Eno's commands, Dennis got to work setting up the teleporter. ... While making his way over, he had activated his shadow, to cover the side view. ... Dennis wasn't someone that was often afraid of beasts, but how often had he had the chance to come close to a Demon tier beast? ... Just being near the thing made him want to turn around and escape as far away as possible, so the only way to work properly was to pretend it wasn't there. ... He paused every time the Dragon let out a loud snore, afraid that it would be a sign of it waking up, but fortunately, each time nothing happened. ... Eno had decided to stay by the tree, observing it closer, which left Mona with pretty much nothing to do. ... Once the teleporter was set up she wanted to explore Blade Island further, looking for any other beasts that she could put to use. ... They needed to work out their defences for protecting the place, but she hadn't left yet and couldn't stop looking towards Eno. ... Eventually she walked up to him and said what was on her mind. ... \"Hey, old man. ... You're actually a vampire, right? ... \" Mona asked. ... \"I was thankful for you saving me back then and looking after me which is why I haven't said much but I just am trying to understand your actions a little more. ... \"\"You must have seen a lot of crap throughout your life, and it's clear you're no ordinary vampire. ... I understand why Quinn is helping us since he was originally human, but what about you? ... Why are you doing so much for us humans? ... \" Mona asked. ... Hearing this, Eno stopped what he was doing for a second and looked at Mona. ... He wasn't staring at her but instead was staring directly behind her as if he was thinking about something. ... \"You know, it's been so long I often forget the reason why I do this. ... \" Eno answered with a slight smile. ... Mona thought at this point that Eno was pulling her leg, if he didn't want to tell her, he didn't have to, but he could just say that instead of making up a bad excuse like that. ... \"However. ... \" Eno continued. ... \"Whenever I think I'm starting to forget I decide to head back to a certain place. ... That reminds me of why I do everything I have done. ... \"\"Us vampires have a history that nearly dates back as far as humans and it wouldn't be the first time my kind would have wiped out an entire race, which everyone else eventually forgot about. ... I fear that history is repeating itself and the same thing might happen again. ... \"After seemingly having said his piece, Eno looked back at the tree again and Mona didn't feel any wiser as to why this enigmatic old man was on their side. ... Just as she was about to head off and do her own thing, thinking the other two would be fine without her, Eno continued his answer, having placed a hand on his chin. ... \"No wait, I don't think that's quite right either. ... The original reason why I wanted to help you humans has changed as time passed. ... You don't need to have lived as long as I have, to have experienced it. ... Your views change drastically from when you were 10 to when you're 20, from when you were 20 to when you're 30 and so on. ... So imagine how many times my views on the world have changed. ... \"\"My reason for helping has changed, sometimes subtly, sometimes drastically. ... Even now I am finding new reasons to help out, but I will say one thing, Mona. ... In the past I have been able to help out people, letting humans avoid their death and end by helping here and there. ... \"\"Perhaps my actions are similar to those gods that don't wish to get involved too much, but this time it appears that if I don't get involved that there will be a real end. ... During the first Dalki War I have merely helped from the background, so getting involved to this degree, poses a huge risk to my own life. ... Something I never even considered before. ... \"\"Perhaps, I shouldn't even be telling you these things, but I am because there is a chance that I won't survive and will never be able to answer your questions again. ... I tell you what, why don't you come over here. ... \" Eno suggested. ... Mona had asked that she had considered one simple question, she hadn't expected the old man to go on rambling, and the way he spoke it was as if he was forgetting what he was saying the moment he said it. ... It was actually making her reconsider if they should really put so much hope into this so-called great scientist. ... Still, she honestly was indebted to this man, and if he wanted to harm her or turn her she would at least let the man have that much for saving her life. ... Walking over, Mona felt a little nervous and at unease, she always did around Eno, despite him doing no harm or showing any immediate red flags. ... When coming over, Eno grabbed her hand and placed a small little circular digital device with a star as its base. ... \"It's a lock that is linked to my heart. ... When I die, or my heart stops beating, that will open up. ... It's a small map which will lead you to my special place. ... If you go there, you will find things that you will need at the time. ... Remember, I am always planning ahead. ... \" Eno stated with a smile.'How can he talk about his own death so easily? ... Is this why I can't shake the dark feeling I get from him?' Mona wondered.*****\n",

      "'The worst century yet' was a phrase that had started to become common in the vampire settlement these days. ... Vampires used to live without much grief or problems, whether one looked at it internally or externally. ... Of course there had been the occasional disputes between the families, but those had usually only affected the families in question. ... Yet somehow one problem seemed to follow the next one, affecting vampire society as a whole lately. ... Despite the new King having been crowned not too long ago, a new council meeting was to take hold soon. ... However, this time the public was very well aware as for the reason behind it. ... When Suzan's body had been seen, the news had spread so rapidly that every single vampire had heard of her demise before her body could even be taken down. ... Not only had a leader been killed, but it had happened in her own castle where she had gotten pinned to the wall. ... What made matters worse, was the fact that the vampire settlement shouldn't be under any external threat of any kind. ... However, the signs were all pointing that the attack had to have been done from someone externally, so fear was growing in the vampires, especially for those in the third family that had just lost their leader. ... Paul, having been given the okay from Quinn, had gone out to attend today's council meeting in his place. ... He arrived at the King's castle, where the Royal guards were guarding the entrance. ... Some in the public were shouting, demanding explanations given the recent event. ... Unlike humans, even regular vampires had great power, but the Royal guards made sure that things remained civil. ... Any leader was allowed to attend with their two Vampire knights, yet because Paul himself was a knight and Leo being here was a secret, he had decided to bring two replacements with him, Timmy, and Xander. ... He had left his second in command Ashley behind since he felt given the nature of the council meeting, actual vampires who knew more about how things worked in the Vampire World, would be better suited. ... The two were over the moon when Paul had selected them, thinking that their hard work had paid off. ... At the same time they were nervous, since they understood the difference in standing between themselves and the others who would attend. ... Even if they weren't in the tenth family, the other knights and leaders would look down on their group when they entered the room, for they were in a place and a position that would perhaps be undeserving if they were with any other family. ... Now standing outside the council door, Xander and Timmy took a deep breath. ... \"Relax, it's unlikely we will be much involved in the meeting. ... As such, I just need you to listen and pay close attention to the reactions of the other leaders. ... Should the need arise, I will be the one talking. ... Honestly, the goal for our family is to try to stay out of this matter as much as possible. ... \"\"As long as it doesn't involve us there is no need for us to help any of them out. ... \" Paul explained, but his mind went back to his talk with Muka. ... About those in the other families that had gone missing. ... He was still wondering whether these two matters were related in some way. ... If that turned out to be the case, then there might be a need for them to get involved, even though he didn't want Quinn to worry. ... The two guards that were standing outside, opened the doors wide and allowed them to walk. ... Another guard led them to the council room and when he opened the door, the trio was surprised that it was in absolute chaos. ... The other leaders were in the midst of discussion and it looked as if everyone else had already long since arrived before them. ... The only ones that weren't present yet were the King and his two Royal knights. ... \"Everyone, please quiet down! ... \" Kazz demanded. ... As the current head of the first family it was usually her job to get the leaders under control, but most of them didn't acknowledge Kazz as a true leader. ... After all, once a real first leader would be selected her position would go back down to being a Vampire knight. ... For a second, her and Paul's eyes met, but they soon looked away from each other again. ... \"A leader was killed in their own home! ... There wasn't even any sign of fighting, so who else could it be if not HIM?! ... \" \"We need to find out the reason why they were targeted. ... Whoever has done this clearly wanted us to see what was going on! ... \"\"Suzan was no weak leader and there were no signs of fighting in her castle. ... She might have been attacked by her own people. ... I demand that we interrogate their knights! ... \"The reason why there was more chaos than usual was also because there were many new vampire leaders in the room. ... After Bryce's election and his selection of Royal knight, there had been a need to fill the void. ... However, soon everyone went silent, as the sound of a clacking cane could be heard from outside the room. ... The sound of the clacking was getting louder and louder and one could tell it was filled with anger. ... The doors were swept open from the other side, the side only the King was allowed to enter from and signs of his red aura could be seen. ... Bryce was there with his eyes glowing red and the energy could be felt from every single one of them in the room. ... 'He has gotten a lot stronger and more confident than before.' Paul analyzed. ... 'Is this just because of the Absolute Blood book?' \"We should have known this was going to happen. ... When we knew of HIS existence we should have gotten rid of him immediately! ... \" Bryce spat out as he walked to sit down on his seat. ... Behind him were Prima, the fastest vampire ever known, and Kyle the vampire with the strongest defense. ... \"In the past many of you didn't believe me that he would be a threat to us and would bring doom to us all. ... There is only one person who is strong and capable enough to not only infiltrate but kill a leader without anyone else noticing it. ... The Punisher, Arthur! ... \"The vampires knew Bryce's strong feelings towards the Punishers, but the fact that he had indirectly allowed Quinn to do his own thing, and had said nothing about Arthur up until this point had made them assume he had decided to let the matter go, yet his reaction made it clear that it was a mistake on their part. ... \"Forgive me, Your Majesty, but what makes you believe this is Arthur? ... \" Jin asked. ... \"I don't know of a reason why he would return and attack us now of all times. ... \"\"You know that all of the Punishers of the old died, so it's only natural that he is blaming us for this. ... \" Bryce replied. ... \"Is there anyone else who would be so daring, who would be capable of such a feat? ... There were no signs of fighting whatsoever, which is proof in itself that the Shadow power must have been used! ... \" Xander and Timmy continued to look around at the Vampire leaders and knights checking if there was any sort of reaction at all like they had been asked. ... Strangely they didn't even have to look hard, for it was visible on some of their faces. ... There were vampires that were panicking about the situation, visibly shaken up at the thought that Arthur had returned. ... \"Although I do think that the most likely person is Arthur, I also think that we shouldn't rule out any other possibilities. ... \" Sunny commented. ... \"After all, none of us have suspected Cindy behind all those wrong doings not too long ago. ... \"This was a recent memory that they wished to forget but it was true. ... Her betrayal had made it abundantly clear that it was possible that a traitor could be hiding amongst them. ... \"Now is not the time for our council to sleep and point fingers at each other. ... \" Prima stated. ... \"We shall act under the assumption that the Punisher Arthur is back. ... Everyone should be putting in measurements in place, to capture the culprit and protect themselves and their families. ... \"Looking towards Paul, Bryce had an evil glint in his eyes. ... \"With the absence of the Cursed family's leader, I hereby call for a vote. ... I suggest forbidding him from returning to the settlement until this matter gets resolved. ... \"This came as a shock to Paul. ... He had never expected them to go this far. ... With this abrupt change, he could no longer just sit around and stay silent. ... \"May I ask for the reason behind such an action? ... \" Paul inquiered, having raised his hand before speaking out of turn. ... \"While I'm not accusing Quinn of being involved in this attack, we know that Arthur has come to his aid in the past when he had been in trouble. ... As much as his help may aid us in this time, as the one who had inherited his shadow power, having him amongst us, would be the same as inviting the Punisher into our midst. ... He could just strike us, and run away whenever needed. ... \" Bryce explained. ... The Vampire King didn't hide his disdain for the tenth family's leader, yet the logic behind his suggestion was sound and that was a problem. ... The council got to voting quickly, and even the vampire leaders that had been on Quinn's side in the past ended up voting to have him stay outside, afraid that Arthur might be behind it. ... \"The original Punisher. ... I do remember he had great power. ... Are you sure we will be able to deal with him? ... \" Tempus asked. ... The vampire spoke without any formalities, which rubbed the other leaders the wrong way a little bit, but as an original vampire he technically outranked them all, allowing him to get away with certain things. ... \"I have a little suggestion with who or how you could solve this problem of yours. ... Many of you probably know that your ancestors including the originals can only be woken up with blood from your own blood line. ... However, for the originals themselves there is one other way. ... \"\"The blood from another Original also works. ... \" Tempus revealed with a smile.******Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "Tempus seemed like an easy going leader for an Original. ... Ever since he had been put in charge of the second family following Cindy's betrayal, he had done well to reformat and implement changes. ... It turned out that there were far more underlying problems than the others had originally thought. ... Under Cindy's rule, the men of the second family had been discriminated against. ... No matter how much promise they might have shown, most had been put aside, never receiving a promotion to the inner castle. ... As for those, who had actually received that highly sought after promotion, they would disappear, having actually been sent off to be tested and experimented on. ... Cindy had been far crueler to her own family members than anyone had realised, having attempted to forcefully create a blood fairy. ... To achieve her goal she had made use of her own ability to revert the changes over certain vampires. ... It was an amazing feat, only possible due to her great proficiency in her own ability, yet it had been an unimaginable torture for her people, one that would repeat over and over again. ... There had even been a few humans that had been captured, once turned into a subclass, if it was one she hadn't been expecting she would revert the change and go through the process again. ... As for the captured vampires, it was to raise an army of Bloodsuckers. ... Tempus had shed light on this mistreatment, quickly abolishing this favoritism, making him well liked amongst his people. ... Of course, the other leaders didn't mind him too much because he had chosen to not get involved or complain about the other families like the other leaders did. ... However, if there was one thing they could complain about, then it would be how frequently he visited the King, and the other leaders believed that the new king and Tempus were playing favours due to him being an original. ... This was the main issue. ... Tempus was an Original, one of the first thirteen that had created the families in the first place. ... He was a figure that was meant to be well respected, which was why nobody thought he was joking with his idea of reviving the others. ... Not only that, but the big question was, why mention this fact. ... Even Bryce was struggling to understand.'There are still vampires from all the original thirteen families.' Bryce thought. ... 'So all of the past leaders and originals can be awakened without using an Original. ... So then why has Tempus decided to reveal this fact to everyone?''Is he setting a trap? ... Did he intend to lure someone into using his blood to awaken the others? ... Or is he simply threatening them, stating that he could awaken the other Originals whenever he wished?'There were many possibilities, and the smile on Tempus' face was annoying even to Bryce, but he did well to hide it. ... Tempus was a good ally to have, and at the moment he couldn't afford to make any more enemies. ... However, there was one other possibility, one of the vampires that couldn't be awoken by the current vampire's bloodline. ... At least there was no way of knowing whose bloodline would work when trying to awaken them, and that was the True First King. ... The original owner of the Shadow ability. ... Only a handful of leaders at the table knew about the True First King, since the rest were too young and all mentions about him should have been removed. ... The rebellion had been caused by the other leaders. ... All of their powers had been used to take him down. ... Ultimately, they had been unable to kill him, only able to force him into a deep slumber. ... His bloodline had been fully erased in order to prevent him from ever waking up again, his family line replaced by another.'Is that why Tempus has brought it up? ... But without his shadow powers could he take on Arthur? ... Is he saying the First True King is even stronger than me with my Absolute Blood Control? ... That has to be impossible!' Bryce believed and tried to disregard his suggestion. ... \"To make sure there is order among the third family, they need to select a replacement leader as soon as possible. ... \" Bryce stated. ... \"I'm sure Suzan already had someone in mind to replace her. ... Until then, her knights will have to take over her duties. ... \"\"We will need to spread the message that our people have no need to panic. ... Arthur has no interest in them, he is only after us leaders. ... Is there any more concerning matters? ... \" Bryce asked, scanning the room. ... At this point and time, Paul was debating with himself what to do. ... He was sure based on Kazz's reaction that the missing vampires had something to do with the first family and most likely the King.'Should I bring up the matter here in front of everyone? ... With Arthur as a distraction, maybe they have yet to realise that their vampires have gone missing? ... I could also say it is out of concern for what is happening now. ... If he says something out of the ordinary maybe we can use this little slip up of his.' Paul thought about his next move. ... Having made up his mind, Paul raised his hand, but a stare from Muka quickly made him put it down just as quickly. ... Alas, Bryce had already looked over and despite his dislike for the Cursed family, for appearance's sake he had to allow him to speak, especially on the off-chance he had something worthwhile to say. ... \"I'm sorry, it was an itch, I do not have any questions. ... \" Paul quickly made up an excuse, looking down. ... Bryce gave him a strange glare, but ignored that remark. ... With nobody else having anything to say, the King declared the council meeting to be over, and the leaders were to head back to their respective castles to do as they wished or as they needed to. ... The tenth family was naturally being most affected by this. ... 'I should tell Quinn as quickly as possible about the matter. ... If he comes here, they will accuse him of working with Arthur which will just put the tenth family in a worse situation. ... Maybe their desire to keep him away might actually be for the best for us. ... \" Paul thought. ... Walking to his castle, he asked Timmy and Xander if they had noticed any strange reactions among the other vampires. ... According to the duo certain leaders had a more shocked reaction when hearing Arthur's name. ... Truth be told, Paul hadn't really needed them to keep an eye out, for it had been obvious on their faces that he already knew the answers about the vampires involved. ... 'Out of the newer leaders there were two of them. ... The new sixth leader, Harlow Muscat and twelfth leader Kim Killton. ... Then of the current leaders, both the Royal knights, Prima Killton, and Kyle who were by the King's side.'The ones Paul was unsure about though, were the second leader Tempus as well as Jill, the ninth family leader. ... Since her family no longer existed, her face was like that of a ghost's these days, making it impossible to read through. ... Finally, there was also Kazz, as Bryce's daughter he was unsure how deeply involved she was in the whole mess. ... It was during their walk that Paul noticed they were being followed, not just by anyone, for even when they entered the inner tenth area. ... He had found that the person had gotten in without any of the guards noticing. ... Paul eventually told Timmy, and Xander to go to the castle ahead of him, stating that he was going to meet up with Ashley and get a few updates. ... Soon he took a turn between two large mansion's where the light of a beast crystal was unable to hit, and he could see a large figure in front of him. ... \"I figured it would be you. ... \" Paul sighed. ... \"I'm sorry for my behaviour, but I can not be seen meeting with you. ... \" Muka explained. ... \"Tensions are high right now as is. ... I also apologise for making you hold your tongue earlier, but it was neither the right place nor the right time. ... \"\"I know the attack shows signs that it was done by Arthur, but it's also possible that someone has done this to rally us up against him before he even arrives. ... Had you brought up what we have discovered, then I'm afraid that you might have been the next one-\"It was at that moment, that Muka turned around, and Paul was ready for a fight, as a third person revealed themselves. ... \"Iâ¦. ... I'm not here to fight. ... \" The female voice quickly declared. ... When seeing who it was, Muka was still on guard, but Paul dropped all intentions of fighting. ... \"You know then, Kazz? ... \"\"I told you not to investigate this, but instead you decided to team up with other leaders about this matter? ... \" Kazz's voice was filled with anger. ... \"Vampires might have a different opinion, but when it involves my people I can't just sit by them. ... Today it might be one or two men whose names I might not even have heard about, but tomorrow it could be those I really care about. ... Turning a blind eye is not my way. ... \" Paul stated. ... Muka was starting to understand the situation, but what he didn't understand was the close relationship Paul and Kazz apparently had with each other. ... Why would the first family leader go out of her way, to tell him not to get involved? ... 'Perhaps, we can use this in some way.'Hearing Paul's words, Kazz stung a little inside, but it also gave her the determination to find her answer. ... \"Before you say anything, let's get inside. ... If it would be disastrous when two family leaders get seen colluding, I can't imagine it getting better with three. ... \" Paul suggested, before heading towards the castle. ... The other two agreed, and took to the shadow of the buildings to scale and enter the castle from one of their windows, which led into Paul's office. ... He often left it open so he could enter this way, but it was at that time that he didn't expect to have two others waiting for him there. ... \"You, I thought you had returned to the Human World! ... \" Kazz exclaimed. ... \"Whether I am in the Human World or not, I don't think that matters now. ... \" Leo replied with Erin who was standing by his side. ... Muka looking at the both of them noticed that despite being in the presence of powerful vampires the girl looked unafraid, if anything it looked like she was ready to take them all on at any second. ... \"I've come here to warn you that the Dalki have appeared on this planet! ... \" *****Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "The fact that Leo and Erin were currently on the vampire planet was meant to be kept a secret from the others. ... After all, Leo held a high position in the vampire settlement as the tenth family's vampire knight. ... If it was any other time, Muka and perhaps Kazz would have questioned what he was even doing here, but the news that he had brought seemed to be more urgent, and with everything going on, what the tenth family were doing seemed to be the least of their worries. ... After hearing the news, both Kazz and Muka looked at each other immediately. ... \"The Dalki, you mean they really have returned to this place. ... This whole matter seems to be getting more complicated by the second. ... \" Muka stated. ... \"This is a matter that we may even have to talk to the king about, and at a time like this while everything is happening. ... \"Judging from how Muka spoke, it was almost as if he wasn't surprised that the Dalki had arrived but more so surprised at the timing of the whole thing. ... \"Why would the Dalki be here? ... Do you have an idea? ... \" Paul asked. ... \"From what I have heard from Quinn, at the moment, they have launched a full attack on the humans. ... Their leaders and bulk of their forces are tied up, so why bother sending the Dalki here? ... \" Paul questioned. ... Although Paul knew about the origins of the Dalki from Quinn's meetings as he informed everyone to keep them up to date on the matter, Paul did not know about specific details. ... \"I don't know much about the Dalki. ... Many vampires don't know about them. ... \" Kazz answered. ... \"We know that the humans are in a battle against them. ... Maybe they came back as a type of revenge against us, but who knows. ... \"Most of the leaders did know of the Dalki that included Muka, so he was debating how much to tell them or if it would even matter if they did know. ... \"The Leaders have never really worried about the Dalki. ... Them coming back here is not too much of a problem. ... The problem for me is who they might have returned with. ... For he had left with them, and this is someone who might also be on our suspect list for the missing vampires. ... \"The person who Muka was thinking of, was none other than Jim. ... Hearing this, Leo and Erin thought the vampire's arrogance was showing. ... They knew more about the Dalki and their history compared to the others. ... When the Dlaki had left the vampire settlement, they were weak. ... This was most likely why they didn't see the Dalki as a threat. ... Of course, none of the leaders were ever worried about the Dalki returning for an attack, and hearing the news of the humans they always considered as weak, losing to their creation was even more reason for them to laugh. ... Still, with Leo and Erin having gone up against the four spike, they knew that the Dalki were strong and no laughing matter, even for the vampires. ... \"We were unable to see how many Dalki there were, but only two attacked us. ... We imagine that a group of them must have come. ... We were also quite far out in the settlement. ... I think we should take this threat seriously. ... \" Leo stated. ... \"The Dalki are confident creatures, who would attack if they believed they had the strength to do so, but the fact that they are waiting for something is more worrying in my eyes. ... If you underestimate the enemy, that could be your biggest downfall. ... \"Not shy with his words as always, Leo spoke his mind. ... He didn't want the foolish actions of those at the top, affect other lives. ... He had seen this happen too many times before, and even himself. ... Despite Leo saying all of this, Muka couldn't get out of his mind the first impression he and the other leaders had of the Dalki and thought Leo's worry was too much. ... \"I think it is best to inform the king, but I will do so after we figure out just who is behind the missing people. ... We now have another suspect. ... \"It was at that moment that Paul noticed the painful look that was on Kazz's face. ... \"It's Bryce, isn't it,\" Paul said. ... \"I can tell. ... \"Shaking her fist, Kazz not answering straight away was enough confirmation for Muka and Paul that they had found their answer. ... \"Yes... ... \" Kazz said, but she could say no more. ... \"What's he doing with the people? ... Why is he taking vampires from each of the families. ... \" Muka questioned, but it was clear that she wouldn't say anything else. ... It had already taken all her will to say yes. ... \"Kazz, you don't have to tell us what your father is doing with those missing people. ... \" Muka sighed in defeat. ... \"But I will say this. ... We will be looking to prosecute the king for the crimes he has committed. ... When the time comes, your testimony, one from his own bloodline and the first leader, will have a big impact on the verdict and the opinion of the other leaders. ... \"Truth be told, when Kazz said yes, she didn't know what to expect to hear, she had been avoiding the consequences that her father might suffer if his crimes came to light. ... If the world knew the truth, and knowing what his fate would be, all got a bit too much for her that tears started to roll down her cheeks. ... \"If... ... If I agree. ... \" Kazz said firmly, making sure they knew she still wasn't entirely on their side. ... \"And I decide to participate in this, then can you promise me one thing. ... That my father doesn't suffer from execution and is instead put into eternal slumber. ... \"\"You know that is not for me to decide, but I promise that I will try to persuade the others as well,\" Muka replied. ... After saying that, Kazz felt like she was no longer needed and decided to leave out of the window. ... Nobody called out to her or said anything else. ... \"It looks like we might be able to move forwards sooner than we thought. ... Leave the Dalki problem to me. ... I shall inform the Royal knights and speak to the other leaders about the best course of action. ... I think at this moment, no matter what we say, Bryce will somehow twist it so that this was Arthur's doing. ... \" Muka said, and soon he left, but not before turning around and looking at Erin once more. ... With the others gone, Paul was a lot more interested in finding out about the Dalki that Erin and Leo encountered. ... So he heard the rest of the details from them. ... \"I was just about to contact Quinn. ... I have to tell him about the council's order, and maybe the Dalki being here means something. ... \" Paul said. ... \"What about you two? ... Will you be staying here? ... I fear that something bigger might happen, and honestly, it would be great to have someone of your strength by my side. ... \"Leo looked towards Erin. ... His task was complete. ... Now even though they were in the vampire settlement and in a castle full of vampires, Erin didn't seem to have this urge to kill. ... At least it wasn't very strong. ... \"I think you are right,\" Leo said. ... \"If Quinn is unable to come here, then I think we might be more helpful here than there. ... However, that is also the reason why we must go. ... We will be back as soon as possible to help you out. ... \"The reason for Leo saying this was because he wanted to meet up with Alex, so his and Erin's weapons could be made and then they would return. ... \"Very well. ... I will be waiting for your return. ... \"At the moment, Quinn could be seen on a green meadow against three Dalki. ... The first one attacked with a thigh kick, but a shadow was soon raised blocking the attack. ... Another of the Dalki had thrown a fist towards his head. ... The shadow tried to move to the position, but it was too slow, so Quinn instead lifted his arm, blocking the attack to his head, then went and grabbed onto it, piercing its skin with his fingers. ... Next, using a flash step, he got in close to Dalki's body, shielding himself from the other two, and punched it directly in the gut. ... Green blood spewed from its mouth, and the Dalki were no longer attacking. ... \"What are you doing? ... \" The Dalki said, bent over. ... \"I know, sorry, it was just instinct,\" Quinn replied. ... To be more precise, the one who had responded at this moment was Vincent, who was in Quinn's body. ... Quinn was able to obtain three Marked once again, currently each of them at the one spike stage. ... What the two of them were doing now was training for both of them. ... Quinn wanted to get more in tune with fighting while using the other two as puppets. ... In turn, he thought the fighting would allow the Dalki to get stronger as they got injured. ... However, there was a second part to this training as well, and that was training Vincent. ... After being with Vincent, Quinn had come to learn of the struggles he had while in his body, so they thought this would be good training for them both. ... This way, Vincent could learn how to use the shadow powers more efficiently in a fight, and Quinn could improve the Dalki. ... \"Hey, I think you're getting a call! ... \" Vincent shouted. ... Hearing this, Quinn no longer was in control of their Dalki and went to his own body. ... When he saw who the call was coming from, he was pretty surprised. ... \"Quinn, this is Paul. ... There's something I need to tell you.... ... \"******\n",

      "Due to the King's order, the third castle was currently going through a difficult situation for more reasons than one. ... Their leader had just been killed, yet they weren't granted any time to grieve for those who cared for the leader and at the same time, there were vampires from other families taking advantage of the situation. ... Disputes between families were quite common, so vampires were a proud bunch. ... They would often compare the strength of each of the families. ... Once in a while this competition would go too far, and result in fighting between the two families. ... If it got too big, the leaders themselves would have to sort it out, but the castle had no such leader at the moment. ... It was the same reason why the tenth family had been treated the way they had been for so long. ... For as long as they lacked a new leader, it would be a vulnerable time for them. ... Inside the castle, in one of the grand dining halls, the late third leader's Vampire knights, May and Verth were going through the candidates to succeed her. ... The woman and man paced back and forth, their foreheads wrinkled deep in thought. ... Meanwhile, sitting in the vacant throne meant for the leader, was a young looking woman with long black hair and a doll-like dress, holding a brown bear in her hand. ... It was a strange sight, because, although she looked very young, it was clear that the one holding the bear should have long been over that age. ... \"Annie, there's no helping it, nobody but you can take this position! ... I know it's a little early but Suzan has been preparing you to take over for a long time already! ... \" May shouted. ... Annie, held onto the bear tightly, and her legs were shaking up and down while also biting her fingernails. ... It was clear she was afraid. ... \"You don't need to do any of the work. ... We can cover for that, but right now the third family needs someone to step up, so we'll have order. ... \" Verth agreed with his female companion. ... \"It's not about being ready or not. ... \" Annie eventually replied in a shaky voice. ... \"If I take that placeâ¦ no, it's probably true for whoever takes the leader role... ... I'm afraid that whoever killed Mother will come after me! ... \"The two vampire knights didn't expect this, that they would ever need to convince someone to take the leader position. ... To the normal vampire folk it was a position they could only dream of. ... Being in charge of an entire family, becoming one of the most respected members of their society. ... \"If you just need a leader, then why can't one of you take the seat?! ... \" Annie crossed her arms and pouted. ... The two of them gulped when they thought of this, a shiver ran down them as they remembered Suzan's body on that wall. ... \"Th-that's because... ... b-because we can't! ... We're knights, after all! ... As her daughter, it's only right for you to succeed her. ... \" May eventually put together an explanation. ... However, Annie may have been naive, but she wasn't stupid. ... Although it was going against their etiquette, it wasn't exactly 'taboo' either. ... Especially in their current time, when the first family was being led by their former knight Kazz, and the council had even granted Silver special permission to take over as leader if anything was to happen to the thirteenth leader. ... It was practically guaranteed that as long as one of them would come forward that due to the circumstances their request to fill in would be granted. ... Yet, neither one of them wanted to admit it once the idea of them actually taking over was placed. ... \"I'm scared, I'm scared out of my mind. ... I know what the right thing to do is, but I just can't. ... \" Annie cried out in defiance. ... \"And so you should be. ... \" A voice said from inside the room, dark shadows surrounding him. ... The two knights, the moment they saw who it was, were now shaking more than ever and almost fell to the floor. ... \"Arthurâ¦'' May mumbled. ... The two of them had only seen his figure once before. ... The Punishers had been abolished by the time they took over, but they were sure of it. ... This was the same vampire they had seen at Fex's execution. ... Lifting both his hands up, the two knights, still unable to move, were suddenly sucked into a deep dark shadow, vanishing in seconds. ... Annie, seeing this, had no clue where they had gone, and she didn't dare move, too afraid that she would follow them if she angered the intruder. ... \"Let's keep the two of them out of our conversation, shall we? ... \" Arthur 'suggested' with a smile as he walked over. ... His entire body was covered in dark clothing. ... He wasn't wearing the blood armour, nor did he carry his trademark sword on his back. ... Were it not for May calling out his name, Annie might not have even known who he was. ... \"Annieâ¦ you seem too young to have been born when I entered my sleep, but you might have already been born when all the other Punishers left this world. ... I am now unable to ask your mother these questions, so it falls on you. ... \" Arthur proclaimed as he came forward. ... 'Does that mean he couldn't torture the information out of my mother?' Annie wondered, swallowing hard. ... Usually leaders had pride, they wouldn't let fear take over and they would rather die fighting than to submit to the one threatening their death, however there was one exception to this rule, the Punisher who could make them experience unimaginable pain. ... \"Iâ¦Iâ¦Will answer whatever you want. ... \" Annie quickly conceded, hoping that Arthur would at least give her a quick and respectful death. ... Suzan might have been too prideful and tried to fight back, but the young woman had no hopes of leaving the place alive now that she had seen who it was, so her best hope was for a quick and hopefully painless end. ... \"Around five hundred years ago, when the last King took over. ... Bryce had gone out on an expedition with a few of the vampire leaders. ... Do you know about this? ... \"Annie nodded. ... \"Great, I'm going to name a few of the old leaders and current leaders and I want you to tell me which of the leaders went on that expedition with Bryce. ... \"Arthur soon went over the list of names starting with the leaders before naming Vampire knights and those in the Royal guard as well. ... Annie nodded to those that had gone with, and shook her head to those that hadn't. ... Arthur didn't expect her to know the names of all the vampires, but one would have at least known the leaders who had left at the time. ... \"Thank you for cooperating so far. ... Now, as for the last name... ... Annie Topper. ... \" Arthur looked up from the list, staring at her with a hint of bloodlust. ... The tears were falling uncontrollably down her face, for a brief moment she considered lying, but the glaring eyes gave her the feeling that they would be able to see through it. ... Even more afraid of the consequences of angering the monster before her, she finally nodded. ... \"Thank you, for telling me the truth. ... I doubt you had much say on the matter, but you still need to be punished for your crimes. ... You're guilty of eliminating the Punishers and their families who only wanted to live a life away from the settlement. ... \" Arthur stated. ... When Annie heard Arthur speak, surprisingly his voice was soft and she could tell that he was almost in pain. ... As if it was something he didn't want to do, but knew it was something he had to do. ... When she heard Arthur talking about the Punishers, her mind went back to that expedition. ... Although it was true that she did take part, at the time she had merely followed alongside her mother, barely helping her. ... Still, that was no excuse for the lives she did take that day. ... \"For your cooperation, you've earned a quick end. ... \" Arthur proclaimed next to her ear, already having shoved his hand through her heart, with it no longer beating.'Now I have a list of who to go for, and every single one of these will receive a punishment, but I will savour the ones that are most guilty.' Arthur thought walking off, a lifeless body slumped behind him on the throne. ... This time, it took a little while longer for the body to be discovered. ... For that day, two Vampire knights, as well as the replacement leader had gone missing. ... It wasn't until the vampires on cleaning duty had entered the castle that they spotted the massacre that had occurred and immediately called for the others. ... The room had been left untouched. ... Entering the room before any of the others was King Bryce, followed by Tempus at his side. ... Looking at the scene, Bryce's blood was boiling with anger. ... \"This is my vampire settlement, and during my time, he is doing this. ... If this continues then the whole vampire settlement could be doomed! ... I will skewer him, twist his body and drain the blood out from his bones! ... \" Bryce shouted in anger, turning around and breaking the door as he pushed it open. ... \"Flashy. ... \" Tempus noted, looking at the broken door and then turning his attention back to the room in front of him. ... Looking at the wall behind the throne, a bloody message had been left behind. ... \"I have a list of you all! ... Admit what was done to the people or all of them will be punished! ... \"*******\n",

It looked like apart from the message their only clue was the dead body. ... \"Does anyone else find it strange? ... \" Sunny asked. ... \"The way Suzan was killed by Arthur? ... When we look at Suzan's death it was a clear fear tactic statement, and you could say this is the same again, but the message here, it was clearly left behind for us, while the first had been for the public to see. ... \"\"Does that really matter? ... \" Jin questioned, unable to see Sunny's point. ... \"Perhaps Arthur had hoped for a certain outcome after Suzan's death, but with us not reacting how he wanted, this time he left behind a clearer message? ... \"Jin walked up to the wall and looked over the message as if hoping it would reveal some sort of secret underneath. ... \"Or whoever these people are that he has annoyed. ...

Surely, they know something that we don't. ... Maybe Arthur wants them to tell the whole settlement what they did. ... \"Sunny stood up and walked up to the blood message on the wall standing by Jin's side. ... \"I think we all knew that from the beginning. ...

This time, it was a single strike through the heart, a rather painless death. ... Now think back to how Suzan was killed. ... Only one of those completely disrespects the deceased's body. ... To top things off, the blood on this wall smells slightly different from Annie's blood. ... \" He understood that things were strange, otherwise Jin wouldn't have stayed behind in the first place to see if there was anything he could find, but he thought that Sunny was perhaps trying to grasp at straws too much. ...

      "Erin and Leo were very interested in finding out what had exactly happened while they had been away. ... Walking alongside Sam around the Cursed ship they noticed that there were many changes here and there. ... Certain parts had been remodeled, different areas had been strengthened and more security systems had been implemented.'Did the Cursed ship suffer from an attack while we were away?' Leo thought. ... 'I guess that much should be expected with the human race at war again. ... Have they gone out to help out other planets?'\"I'm sorry, Sam. ... \" Erin apologised, after noticing through her ability that there were far less people on the Cursed ship than the last time they had been there. ... \"It looks like you guys have been attacked during our absence. ... If we had been here, probably less lives would have been lost. ... Just what happened that there are so few people left? ... \"It took a second for Sam to figure out what Erin meant by this, but then he remembered that he had yet to fill them in. ... \"We have lost a lot of lives, but not as many as you seem to believe. ... \" Sam replied. ... \"The actual reason why there aren't that many on the Cursed ship right now is because many chose to leave the ship. ... \"\"After we were attacked, our Cursed faction temporarily made the Earthborn group's Shelter on planet Caladi into our base. ... Although the Cursed ship is back and running again, many decided to stay there for the time being. ... \" \"As I said, a lot happened while you guys were away, but we pulled through. ... I'm sure the two of you were busy doing your own important thing as well. ... Heck, we even heard that we have you to thank for defeating a four spiked Dalki on Earth! ... \"The duo thought they had been quite careful at the time, but a blind swordsman wasn't exactly a common occurrence, making him easy for many to remember. ... With Pure seemingly having erased all of their traces the public believed that Leo was the one to have finished the enemy on his own. ... Finally, the trio had reached Quinn's private training room where the surprise had been left for Leo and Erin. ... Even before they entered the room, through the Glathrium door the two of them could feel the intense energy inside, and the hallway feeling a little cooler. ... The closer they got to the door the cooler the air felt. ... For Erin though, it was simultaneously a familiar and foreign feeling. ... Someone who had ice abilities was used to this chill, but it didn't quite feel the same as an ability. ... After Sam put in the code the door slid open, and the two of them could clearly see what was in front of them. ... \"Leo, do you see thatâ¦it's theâ¦'' Erin was unable to speak normally as she naturally walked forward, drawn to the weapon. ... \"For even my own student to forget that I lack sight. ... \" Leo shook his head. ... \"I do feel it though. ... There is no other weapon that I have ever felt that comes close to it. ... This has to be a Demon tier weapon. ... \" Leo and Erin had not been present when Oscar had shown the Demon tier weapon to everyone, so this was the first time the two were in its presence. ... Being near a Demon beast item or weapon for the first time certainly had an effect on everyone. ... Its raw energy was calling out to the both of them, for them to pick it up and use it immediately. ... \"It looks like you like the gift Quinn left you then. ... \" Sam smiled from behind them. ... \"This is the gift Quinn left for Leo? ... Just what happened for something like this to end up in the Cursed faction's hand? ... Why doesn't he want to use it for himself? ... Isn't this too much? ... \" Erin was shocked that Quinn wouldn't use such a thing for himself, yet she couldn't keep her eyes off the weapon. ... \"As I said, a lot has happened while you guys were away. ... Quinn actually has his own Demon tier item. ... To fully utilise the power of this one he would have to incorporate it into his set of skills. ... \"\"However, Quinn has gained another special sword that he claims suits his fighting style far more than this one. ... Additionally, he doesn't think that it's a good idea for all our fighting power to be focused on just one person. ... \"With the war going on, and the enemy turning out to be far stronger than we could have imagined, it seemed wiser to give the weapon to someone better suited and who could be better suited to use a Demon tier Sword than a swordsman? ... \"Walking up to the sword, Leo stared at it, sensing its powers. ... He certainly did have an interest in obtaining a stronger weapon. ... That was his goal of coming back here, after all, but Leo wasn't used to receiving gifts as big as this from others. ... He had always obtained things himself, the fact that it came from a student he used to teach, didn't make it any less strange. ... \"This is no small surprise. ... \" Leo grabbed the hilt of the sword, and he could feel his whole body run with a cold shiver. ... He lifted it up with a single hand, with complete ease. ... It looked strange from the outside since the sword was three quarters the size of his body. ... Giving it a test, he started to swing it in separate movements. ... First a step forward slicing it in an arc shape. ... Next from below, almost skimming the bottom of the ground, and finally from over his head stopping before the large blade would hit the ground. ... To both Erin and Sam who were watching, just these three simple strikes looked incredibly impressive. ... 'Even with a large weapon like this, he can control the flow of the sword so it doesn't feel unnatural. ... He is a master of all swords, not just the katana blade.' Erin thought as she watched him, a slight feeling of envy rose inside of her. ... \"This weaponâ¦\" Leo said slowly, looking at it once more, giving it another swing to make sure. ... \"It does not suit me. ... Neither the size nor shape fit my personal fighting style. ... \" \"However, I agree with what Quinn said and his reasoning for wishing to give me the blade. ... I assume since he gifted it to me, it's mine to do with what I want, correct? ... \"At first, Sam couldn't believe what he was hearing. ... Was Leo really going to reject the Demon tier Sword? ... Even if it wasn't what he was used to, the extra power from it alone would increase his strength, or he could switch between weapons, but after his question, Sam understood what he was planning. ... \"Of course. ... \" Sam smiled. ... \"You know what Quinn is like and I'm sure he will be happy with the decision you are making. ... \"It was then that Leo started to walk over to Erin. ... \"You needed Two blades, remember? ... I remember one of the blades you used to have was similar to this one. ... With this weapon, I'm sure you'll not just be able to revive your family's swordsmanship, but bring it to new heights. ... \"With this Leo handed over the weapon and Erin held it firmly in her hands. ... The cold feeling enveloped her entire body but it was nothing that she couldn't handle. ... She found herself naturally grasping the handle with both of her hands, and before even saying anything, she immediately gave it a few swings. ... When swinging it in a crescent shape, she allowed the blade to slightly take control, lifting her feet off the ground, going straight into the next movement. ... Her body was now a good meter and a half in the air, and striking down again, she spun her whole body a full spin, until finally landing on the ground and completing a final sweep strike on the floor. ... Seeing this, Sam was equally impressed with her sword skills, even though he was no swordsman. ... Being a vampire he was able to track her movements very carefully and he had seen his fair share of fights. ... He could tell that the movements were just as fluid as the ones that Leo had produced. ... 'Indeed, seeing her just swing the Demon tier Sword around, nobody will be able to complain about her having it.' Sam thought. ... It was then that Erin snapped out of her daze. ... She wasn't meant to accept the sword in the first place, but her body had taken over the moment she held it. ... \"I can't. ... Leo, this was your gift from Quinn. ... You need a weapon and it will be far better in your hands. ... \" Erin said, bowing down and holding the sword out for Leo to take. ... \"Yes and I believe I just said that since it's my gift I can do what I want with it. ... Remember, I still have a gift from that fellow from before. ... I'm certain that Alex will be able to make a fine weapon out of it, one that he can customise for my use. ... \" Leo stated. ... \"While I appreciate your sentiment, do you honestly believe a weapon that utilises ice powers of all things would be better in my hands? ... I'm sure that you felt it yourself when using that sword, so you should know that answer. ... \"\"The moment you took it, I felt its power spike up, something that didn't happen when I took it. ... I would say, even if you didn't want it, that blade has chosen you. ... Combine it with the skills you've learned, and continue to improve the skills of the current you. ... \"In all honesty, Erin was happy that Leo didn't want the sword back, she had just felt like she had been undeserving of it. ... She hadn't achieved any great feat nor fought against a mighty foe and yet here she was receiving one of the strongest weapons in the world, but she had felt it. ... Just like what Leo had claimed, the moment she had touched it, it had felt so familiar to her. ... Perhaps it was because of her lost ice powers, and the purpose of the weapon. ... Nonetheless now it was hers to keep. ... \"Thank you, Leo. ... Thank you Sam. ... \" Erin bowed to them both. ... \"I promise to prove to everyone that I deserve to use this weapon. ... \"\"Haha, no need to thank me. ... I'm just the messenger boy, if you want to thank somebody besides Leo, thank Quinn the next time you see him. ... \"Having improved in her strength by leaps and strides she was just wondering how much stronger she had gotten. ... With the Demon tier Sword in her hands, she couldn't help but consider herself becoming almighty, but that also made her think of one other thing. ... 'That women, the prophecyâ¦. ... is it really okay for me to have so much power? ... What happens, if what she said is true? ... What happens if at some point Iâ¦' Gripping the sword tightly, she shook her head. ... 'No, I've never believed in any of that crap and I won't start now. ... I won't let it happen!'******Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "After obtaining the Demon tier weapon, Sam suggested for Erin to wrap it up for the time being to keep it away from the eye of the others. ... He had prepared a basic blue coloured cloth which was placed on Erin's back, but she planned to ask Alex to make a special sheathe, so they could better hide the strong energy radiating from it. ... Before meeting with the forger though, Leo and Erin were both interested to hear just what exactly had happened to this place, since Sam had been vague so far. ... \"I don't plan to keep silent about this matter, I just thought it would be easier for you to see for yourself. ... \" Sam explained. ... \"Luckily for you guys, nearly the whole thing was caught on tape. ... \"Heading to the command centre, on the way they stopped by Logan's office. ... There wasn't much for them to talk about, but Leo gave a few words of encouragement like a teacher would to their students, while Erin couldn't stop staring at the robotic arm underneath, until she eventually spoke up. ... \"At least you didn't have to get turned into a vampire. ... You've always been a bit different and unique, this just makes it more so. ... \". ... Logan thought about her statement for a moment. ... It hadn't really bothered him that much, but he guessed she had a point. ... \"Thank you. ... \" Logan simply replied. ... An awkward encounter to say the least, from two students who had never really talked to one another. ... Next they headed to the command centre. ... Using the big screen, Sam showed them everything, starting from when Quinn and the others had been attacked by Innu. ... At times he informed them about certain things not caught on tape. ... Of course, they already knew some of what was going on, even when they had been tracking down Pure they had kept up to date with things, but Sam wanted to give them the necessary context they might need. ... After all, they knew nothing about Supreme Commander Oscar's demise, the new member Shiro, the invasion of the Dalki and many other things. ... At the end of it, Erin almost felt tired just listening to the story, as she imagined herself being in each of the situations they had been through. ... \"Theyâ¦. ... they went through all of that. ... \" Erin murmured to herself, her mouth left wide open. ... Now she felt even less deserving of the weapon on her back. ... Her earlier proclamation of wanting to prove that she deserved to wield the blade suddenly felt a whole lot heavier. ... Looking over the two, Sam could tell that they were deep in thought, perhaps feeling guilty that they had been absent at such a crucial time. ... \"Look guys, nobody blames you. ... All of us know that you were doing something important and you wouldn't just have left without good reason. ... \" Sam said. ... \"Nobody knows what would have happened if you were here and we can't change the past, so there's no point mulling over it. ... \"\"I didn't show you everything so the two of you would feel guilty or so that you would stay here rather than return to the Vampire World. ... Honestly, in my opinion it would be better for you to go back. ... After Quinn received the news of what was happening, he was even debating whether to outright ignore the order from the council and get involved. ... \"\"With both of you there, I think it would give him a little piece of mind. ... \"Hearing this was definitely the type of encouragement they both needed. ... Even Leo, although wise in his age and experience, had never quite been faced with such a situation like they were currently in. ... He had his own agenda with Pure, his responsibilities as a Vampire knight, a leader of the Cursed faction and his student Erin all to balance carefully. ... \"Thank you Sam, if it weren't for the many reliable people the Cursed faction has managed to gather I don't think I would be able to achieve as much as I have done so far. ... \"ââWith that, it was finally time for the two of them to head to the forgery room to accomplish their original reason for coming back to the Cursed faction. ... As always the sound of clanging was heard as they were approaching, and when the doors opened, they were expecting to see Alex hammering away with his other assistants on board, but the two of them were in for another shock. ... As expected they could see Alex, hammering away freely with his wings out, but next to himâ¦.'Did Quinn create another Blood fairy?' Erin wondered. ... 'No, is he maybe another subclass? ... An evolution perhaps?'The surprises didn't seem to stop. ... She had never seen the giant guy next to Alex before, and she was remembering the troubles the Cursed faction had gone through in the Vampire world just having one Blood fairy. ... There was no need for the two to announce that they had entered the room, for straight away, Andrew looked up and stared directly at Erin. ... \"My word, I never thought I would see it back here again, yet here it is. ... \" The large man spoke, as he lifted up his forging mask, and put his hammer down. ... His giant red wings started to flap about fast with excitement walking towards Erin.'What is going on? ... Why is he coming towards me?' Unable to make heads or tails of the situation, Erin went to grab the weapon, but before she reached it. ... Alex noticed that Andrew had stopped his work. ... Looking over he saw Erin's actions. ... \"Hey, relax, both of you, we're all on the same side! ... \" Alex exclaimed nervously, worried his wings could be sliced off at any second. ... The few times he had talked and dealt with Erin, she hadn't exactly been the patient type of person. ... With both sides having calmed down, Alex introduced the returning duo the giant forger and told them that Andrew was the one who had worked on the Demon tier weapon that Erin currently wielded. ... After learning of this fact, her whole demeanor completely changed. ... \"Thank you so much for creating such a masterpiece. ... \" Erin bowed down, several times. ... \"This weapon, the balance, everything about it is perfect for my use. ... \"This was something that Alex would have never imagined the old Erin doing, she had certainly changed a lot since the last time he had seen her. ... \"Haha. ... \" Andrew started laughing, not really being offended by Erin's prior actions at all. ... He was just happy to see the weapon again. ... \"Originally I created it for a man the same size as me, so I find it a little strange you saying that the weapon is a perfect fit for yourself. ... \"\"Go on then, what do you want us to make? ... \" Alex smiled, knowing full well that the only time people came down here was when they wanted someone to make a weapon for him. ... Perhaps some would feel a bit sad at this, but making weapons was Alex's favourite thing to do, and the fact that people trusted him so much these days to personally make a weapon for them, was a blessing that he had never thought he would be able to achieve in the past. ... \"I have obtained a Demi-god tier crystal, but it is only one. ... I hope it will be enough to create a katana-like blade. ... You can use mine for reference. ... \" Leo stated his request, taking his off, and handing it over to Alex. ... The second Alex touched it though, he immediately dropped it to the floor. ... \"Sorry, it must have been my butter fingers. ... \" Alex said, knowing this wasn't true, as a forger he had strong fingers, and when he went to pick it up again, he dropped it almost immediately as a strange feeling could be felt when holding the sword.'No wonder this forger is special, even he can feel that it's cursed.' Leo thought. ... Finally, on a third attempt, Alex picked it up with both hands firmly. ... \"Tell me, this sword is important to you, correct? ... You have only brought me one Demi-god tier crystal so I don't know if it will be enough to create you a weapon of the calliper that is needed, but recently I came across an upgrade crystal and with it I found out a few new techniques. ... If you are willing to test it out. ... I could try to use the Demi-god tier crystal to upgrade your current weapon instead. ... \"No sorry that would be wrong, it would be a new weapon, using the current sword to give the Demi-god tier weapon a boost. ... \"Hearing this, Leo thought it was a great opportunity. ... Honestly he didn't want to stop using his current weapon, for it carried the will of his former companions with him, but if the weapon could be used, would the Cursed effect move on to the new weapon. ... \"What are the chances of success? ... \" Leo asked. ... \"Fifty percent. ... Well that's not completely correct. ... It's guaranteed that it will be a Demi-god tier blade, although it might be on the low end and closer to a Legendary tier weapon, but if it worksâ¦\"\"Please, I will put my trust in you. ... \" Leo interrupted him. ... After that, the two made two more requests for a blood weapon to be made from the many blood crystals that Erin had gathered. ... For the blood weapon the best crystals were selected while the others were given to Alex to keep and use how he wished. ... Meanwhile, Andrew would be making a special sheath to cover the Demon tier Sword's energy. ... A task he was most pleased to do. ... Of course the weapons would take a while to make, so both Erin and Leo were left on the ship for a while, and for the first time they could eventually rest. ... In doing so, and with nothing to do, Erin decided that there was someone that she needed to visit who she hadn't done in a long time. ... While heading to the canteen, the two of them finally met again. ... \"Layla! ... \" Erin called out. ... \"Erin,\" Layla called out back, dropping her plate of food out of surprise, but Erin caught it before it could touch the floor. ... Leo, who was with them to grab some food, noticed something with his ability almost straight away, that by Layla's waist she had a sword. ... \"Hey, When did you get a new sword? ... I knew you had the old one but you hardly used it. ... \" Erin asked. ... Looking at the energy surrounding the sword, something was incredibly off about it. ... Usually beast weapons gave off a red colour which Leo could perceive through his ability, the same as beasts themselves. ... In the same vein, vampires gave off a purple energy, so what was up with this weapon that looked to have black flames spiralling from it.*****Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "After each of them grabbed something to eat, they decided to sit down together to talk a bit more. ... Erin acutely didn't have to consume blood and could eat a regular diet similar to humans; this was the same for Layla. ... However, Leo had just grabbed one of the juice boxes with a small amount of blood inside. ... Drinking such an amount of blood no longer troubled him when trying to control himself since he was so in tune with his senses, but if a vampire were to deprive themselves of blood entirely for too long, they would feel tired and a little weak. ... As for the reason Leo decided to sit beside them, was because he wanted to find out a little more about the sword. ... He was sure that Layla didn't know how unique it was and would bring it up to her once he found out more. ... The two of them got to talking and how exactly a particular sword had gotten into her hands. ... Even though the match against Burnie was televised, the whole saga of what happened with the second Pure leader was not. ... \"I'm sorry Layla,\" Erin said. ... \"If I was there, maybe I could have helped out more, but it sounds like you turned into quite the fighter. ... You managed to unlock the fourth form and summon all of that Qi? ... \"She wasn't used to getting compliments, so Layla's face was appearing a little redder. ... \"I mean, I can't really summon my fourth form at will, and my body is too weak to handle the Qi in my body without it. ... If I summon all of the Qi in my body, it hurts, and besides, the Qi in my body is not even mine in the first place. ... It's my mothers. ... \"Honestly, both Leo and Erin were a little disheartened after hearing Layla's story. ... They had gone searching for high ranking members of Pure and never ran into them, and yet, Layla did and had to go through such a troubling experience without them there. ... It was clear that what happened with Agent 2 was a sensitive subject. ... When Layla explained what he had said about her mother, she had choked up a few times. ... \"Your achievements are still your achievements. ... \" Leo finally spoke. ... \"The weapons we use to aid us, the Qi that we use, is an energy that is borrowed from the outside, and the food we eat helps us to grow. ... Without our parents, we would have never been born in the first place. ... All of these things could be considered help from other forces. ... \"So don't downplay what you did. ... Even if someone had the same Qi as you, they wouldn't have been able to control it as well. ... If one thing, me and Erin can sense the strong Qi in your body, and for you to handle it so well, is a feat in itself. ... \"Thinking about things like this, Layla was a little happier. ... She had spent some time with both Leo and Erin before they had left, and it was good to have them back again. ... \"Leo, I know you wanted to know some stuff about Pure. ... I don't know how much you found out, but an agent is on board the Cursed ship as a captive. ... With the influence skill, we were unable to get things out of him, but if you like, you two could try as well. ... \" Layla said. ... The two were thankful to find this out. ... Leo had found out the information he needed to find out he was on the right track. ... Now all he needed to do was find out where Pure was, or more importantly, where Agent 0 was. ... \"Thank you,\" Erin replied. ... \"About your sword, I guess since you discovered the fourth form, you've been practising a little bit more with it. ... Why don't the two of us have a little spar? ... We can show each other a few things. ... \"Immediately, Layla started to shake her hands. ... \"Erin, what could you learn from me? ... I am far weaker than you. ... It would be no contest. ... \"\"Stop being so humble. ... It's okay to brag once in a while. ... \" A voice from behind said, soon pulling one of the chairs back, and he sat down with the others. ... The one that had arrived was Nate, who had brought a slab of raw-looking meat with him on his plate. ... Nate was concerned about his body since he used it to train in martial arts. ... He made sure he always got the right amount of protein in, but he wasn't sure if it mattered anymore now, he was a vampire. ... Still, the only thing that he could still taste and not throw up was lightly cooked meat which in a way was perfect for him. ... \"I know how strong you are. ... \" Nate continued to say. ... \"In that video, a lot of people give me credit for being the main person to defeat Burnie, but that's not true at all, and you know it. ... You managed to transfer your Qi into me, and without that sword of yours, those flames would have hurt even more. ... Remember, he was one of the big four, so if you call yourself weak, you are also calling him weak. ... And well, me who couldn't even beat him without your help even weaker. ... \"On top of that, you nearly beat Helen, the leader of Daisy in a one on one duel, and that was before you knew how to use your crazy powers and was just starting to learn how to use Qi a little better. ... \"Those on the ship were used to Nate exaggerating a little bit, but at the moment, he really wasn't. ... Listening to what they said, Leo paid closer attention to the video they had watched not too long ago. ... In particular, he was thinking back to the fight they had seen with Burnie.'Was Layla really able to transfer Qi to another and form a distance? ... It makes sense what Nate is saying then and adds up in the video. ... Is it possible that she was also able to combine Qi with her ability? ... If that is true, then what she has is even better than the third stage of Qi. ... She could power items from a distance and others. ... This is an incredible ability and power to have.' Leo imagined just how he would use such an ability and the many ways one could utilise it. ... Layla was perhaps unaware of how valuable such a thing was, and if he could push her in the right direction, she would become a strong force on the Cursed faction team. ... \"I think it would be a good experience for the two of you to fight each other. ... Leo eventually said after gathering his thoughts. ... \"It sounds like there are many things the two of you can learn from each other. ... Also, I would like to see the passive skill of the sword in action. ... The one that was capable of blocking even the fire powers of one of the great four. ... \"âââReluctantly, Layla eventually agreed to the request, and they were in one of the many training rooms on the Cursed ship. ... She always found it hard to say no to people, and it was even worse when an elder like Leo asked her. ... Nate had also decided to come along since he was interested in seeing the match between them. ... \"Layla, before the match starts, I want you to use everything you have,\" Erin said, as she placed the cloth wrapped sword down on the floor away from where the two were about to do battle. ... Using a Demon tier weapon she didn't know how to use would be dangerous. ... On top of that, Erin didn't really think it was fair. ... \"That fourth form you spoke about, you said you can't freely bring it out, but I want you to try. ... \"Nate was smiling in excitement. ... He knew Erin was strong before but thought they probably had no idea how strong Layla had gotten, and the two of them would be in for a surprise. ... They drew their weapons. ... Erin's shaped like a katana sword, while Layla's was more similar to a standard longsword. ... The fight had begun, and Erin was the first to strike, giving out a quick slash from a distance, striking out a line of red aura. ... Seeing this, Layla stayed calm. ... The sword had done her well so far. ... 'This sword can even block the energy of Qi, so it should be the same for the vampire aura as well!' Layla thought as she struck the red aura, making it disappear as the sword hit it. ... As expected, the blade had negated even the vampire aura. ... Erin was a bit lost at what to do next. ... She had combined her Qi with the red blood aura to create quite a strong attack, similar to what Quinn and Leo did. ... She was hoping, based on how much Layla would have struggled with the attack, she would have adjusted how the two of them would fight from there, but the way the black sword had gone through the red aura was effortless. ... Now knowing her sword worked well, Layla decided to go on the attack instead. ... She pulled out her bow from her back and fired three Qi filled arrows towards her opponent, and started to control the direction they were going, but that wasn't the only thing Layla had done. ... Controlling the three arrows with one hand, she charged forward with the blade in the other. ... With the first arrow, Erin's sword struck against its head straight on, and to her surprise, there was resistance until eventually, she was able to cut it in half. ... 'Is this the strong Qi in her body? ... My body has improved. ... I know my strength, and my Qi is strong, yet I still couldn't cut her arrows cleanly.' Erin thought. ... 'Layla, you really have gotten a lot better.'\"Hahaha, and you guys haven't even seen her transform yet,\" Nate said out loud like some type of cheerleader for her. ... \"Both of their growth is impressive. ... Perhaps before we leave this ship, the two of them can complete that,\" Leo said. ... \"That? ... \" Nate asked, not sure what 'that' was referring to. ... \"There is still a way the two of them can improve their strength quickly in a desperate situation. ... If we can, I would like for Erin and Layla to unlock their soul weapon before we leave. ... \"*****Get access to the MVS webtoon on P. ... a. ... t. ... r. ... e. ... o. ... n, it's only $3 dollar a month and read My Werewolf System exclusively. ...

      "The fight between the two young women continued. ... Layla mainly used her arrows as a type of distraction while also throwing out her black balls that when hit would summon the Spiritual chains trapping her for a few seconds, but since Erin knew what they did she was able to avoid them easily. ... Surprisingly, Layla had become the aggressor in their training fight, Erin had remained on the defensive attacking her with a few simple Blood swipes and with her sword now and again. ... However, those attacks proved to be ineffective in front of the black sword. ... Despite the speed the attacks were coming out towards her at, Layla had enough control to power her body with Qi, allowing her arms to move at a faster speed, if she were to attack with sword itself though she didn't have much options. ... Afraid that in her regular form, she would be outmatched in strength in a head on clash. ... The downside of the black sword was that it negated anything it came into contact with, including Layla's Qi, if she tried to empower it or her own Telekinesis ability on the blade itself as well. ... Without transforming, the only thing she could do was use her arrows to attack. ... \"Erin has become far more patient. ... \" Leo noted from the side. ... \"After realising her first attack had been negated, she is now testing out the limits of Layla's capabilities. ... \"Leo was commenting on the fight, pointing out the good points and bad points of both sides. ... Nate, who was standing by his side, was wondering just who the words were exactly meant for, but his thoughts were also on something else. ... Since he could just listen to the analysis of the fight thanks to the Blind Swordsman, Nate kept staring at Leo's eyes.'Is he really blind? ... His pupils are white and everything, but then how is he able to tell so clearly what's going on in the fight? ... Well, that much he might have been able to feel, but just how the hell did he manage to watch the video of us fighting then?' Nate wondered, but he didn't consider it proper to ask the other. ... There were only a few people that had experienced the vision that Leo could see through his ability. ... That being Erin who had the same ability and Vorden when he had once borrowed it. ... The ability that both Leo and Erin shared was called Dragon Eyes. ... It allowed the ones who had this ability to see everything in a wireframe like view. ... Leo could actually see the people in front of him, the room around them and if a leaf were to fall down he could see that too, only from his perspective it would look like a small object made up of small white lines. ... What this also meant, was that Leo was actually able to see through objects and walls and what was over on the other side. ... However, he was unable to see the natural colour of things. ... The amazing thing about this type of view was that it allowed him to differentiate between different types of life energy by their respective colours. ... He could see this energy in such detail that it would often move before the person themselves moved as well. ... However, these colours that represented different energies when using his ability were different to when he was sensing them using his Qi. ... For example, Dragon Eyes showed vampires as a mass of purple energy, humans as a yellow energy, and beast as a red type of energy. ... But if Leo was to use his Qi to sense energy, the vampire internal energy would appear red. ... Because of how his ability worked, Leo was able to watch the videos on the screen just fine, it just looked different to how others would perceive it. ... He was unable to tell from the first glance who was who on the screen and had to guess from the wireframe shapes. ... Also due to it being a video, he couldn't sense the energy coming off them, but thanks to the commentary and Erin by his side, he had managed to figure out certain details along the way. ... The fight was starting to heat up, as Layla had transformed into their second form, where she now had the speed and strength of a regular vampire and with her added Qi she would be even stronger. ... 'This body can handle a bit more of the Qi that's in my body, but not as much as the fourth form, and I can't use the abilities of any of the other forms, but this will have to do! ... \" Layla thought charging in, but suddenly before she could even swing her sword in a full motion, Erin went on the offensive. ... The suppression chains came off and she swung them out, wrapping around Layla's arms to the side. ... \"The first form. ... \" Leo commented, recognising the movements. ... The suppression chains when wrapped around Layla's arms also made her feel slightly weaker and with Erin's strength, she was able to yank her arm away, pulling her sword and strike to the side, so it had hit nothing but the floor. ... Straight after, Erin was already directly in front of her, and the Dhampir thrusted her sword forward directly into the other's stomach. ... At the last second, she turned the sword so only the guard of the sword had hit her, and Layla was sent flying back with the chains released.'Now for the second form!' Erin thought, as she pulled her chains back. ... \"That's enough! ... \" Leo declared the end of this fight. ... Hearing that, Erin took a second to look over Layla's condition. ... The other still hadn't recovered from the attack. ... \"Layla, I asked you to fight me at your full strength. ... Where was your fourth form? ... \" Erin questioned, disappointed. ... She had been looking forward to testing out the new swordsmanship style she had created against someone other than Leo, but after the first form, Layla seemed unable to fight for a while. ... After recovering a little bit Layla finally answered, fidgeting a bit towards the end. ... \"I tried, but the first time it happened I... ... I ended up losing control. ... I just haven't been able to transform into that again... ... ever since. ... Not even back then during the fight... ... even though we could have really used it... ... \"Walking over, Erin gave her hand out and lifted her friend off the ground. ... \"You... ... are you afraid of using it? ... Trust me, I understand. ... The whole reason why me and Leo needed to leave this place was because I needed to find a way to control myself. ... Thanks to Leo I managed to do it and if I can manage to suppress my condition, I just know you'll be able to as well. ... I'll look forward to the time the two of us can fight again. ... \"In all honesty, it had been the fact that Layla had been so impressive at the beginning of their fight that Erin had believed that there was more to come. ... For this reason, she had gotten swayed up in the flow of the fight, and when she had seen Layla's second form and her opponent holding the sword like that, it had been her chance to act. ... Nate couldn't quite believe it. ... He had only seen one of the forms, but was trying to imagine what he would have done differently to deal with the situation. ... His fighting sense was far better than Layla's but he could tell that a lot of thought was put into linking an attack with the chains and sword after.'The best thing to do is to avoid the chains, I wonder what the second form would have looked like?'\"Excellent. ... \" Leo walked over, clapping his hands to congratulate the progress of the two of them. ... \"Layla, I was able to see the Qi you added to those arrows. ... Not only did you supply them with Qi when you were touching them, but you managed to also supply more to them after they had left your bow. ... I think there is great room for improvement for both of you. ... \"\"I've decided that while me and Erin are waiting for our weapons, I will personally train the both of you. ... For the next week we will focus on you two learning what your soul weapons are. ... \"In the Cursed faction, Layla hadn't been the only one that had been mulling over her weakness. ... For there was one other that had felt like he hadn't been that much help during the Blade family's attack. ... In the research room, Logan was currently working away from the other, creating another anti jammer device to be sent to another one of the planets. ... The Cursed faction's planets had been the priority, but now they had also been requested to help the Graylash group as well as the Earthborn group as well. ... \"You don't understand, Logan! ... He just slapped me! ... It was a single slap and because of his stupid ability I was unable to retaliate! ... I didn't even manage to get so much as a single punch in! ... A freaking slap! ... \" Peter shouted, getting more and more annoyed at himself as he remembered his 'fight' with Hilston. ... Pausing his work, Logan looked over. ... One of the reasons he and Peter had been getting along so well, had been that both had been rather 'emotionless', yet if one were to look at the Wight this was hard to believe. ... Aware that if he didn't comfort Peter, this could go on for a long time, Logan spoke up. ... \"I think you are being a bit too hard on yourself. ... Remember who you were up against. ... He wasn't considered the strongest human in the world for nothing. ... We all saw what that man was capable of. ... If I had been the one to fight him, my whole body would have most likely been crushed by that single slap you keep mentioning. ... \" With that Logan went back to his work, believing that to be the end of this argument. ... \"But even he wasn't enough. ... \" Peter added. ... \"Even he lost the fight against Slicer, and if he didn't have his Demon tier Armour he would have been doomed. ... I know I keep getting stronger based on Quinn's growth and I can feel that, but then how am I meant to help everyone if I'm just a weaker version of Quinn? ... \"Letting out a sigh, Logan stopped his work again, facing Peter once more. ... \"Although you may get your strength from Quinn, you and him are not the same, Your fighting style, your experience, your weapons and such are all different. ... Just focus on those differences between the two of you and use them to your advantage. ... \"Peter started to consider Logan's advice. ... \"Let's see... ... I heal quicker than Quinn does to the point I can practically regrow limbs. ... I eat human flesh instead of blood... ... but none of these things have ever helped me in a fight. ... \"\"Isn't there one more thing that you can do that you haven't really fully utilised? ... \" Logan asked with a raised eyebrow. ... That's when it clicked in Peter's head, there was one thing that he could do that was different from Quinn. ... \"The Wights! ... I can create other Wights! ... \"\"It seems like you got it. ... From what I have learned from watching Quinn, vampires are still able to evolve, especially their skills and at a much quicker rate than humans can. ... \"\"Perhaps there is something else you can do other than just creating Wights. ... If it was me, I would keep them and run tests to check if they could evolve into something else. ... \"\"Since you should have roughly the same power as Quinn, just Imagine if they could match up to you in strength! ... \" Logan encouraged his friend... ... and with that he got back to work.'Wights huh... ... but I would need dead bodies to create them. ... Where would I find dead bodies on the Cursed ship, and who?' Peter thought to himself.******\n",

      "MESSAGE: My Werewolf system is now out on Webnovel as well! ... Search My Werewolf System. ... (The one with a purple cover and a werewolf boy on the front)******Using his head during a fight wasn't really Peter's strong point. ... Ever since he had turned into a Wight, he had strong emotions that would lean one way or another. ... These were to be aggressive or protect. ... Anything that would make him angry, Peter would act on. ... If Quinn in particular was ever in trouble, he would risk his life without a second thought to protect him. ... Still, Peter himself had been noticing that his thoughts were becoming more natural as he started to experience more things. ... The aggression was still within him. ... Even the most minor things would annoy him, such as people leaving their food behind in the canteen without putting it in the trash. ... Images flashed in his head of picking up the tray and whacking it across one of the members' heads, teaching them a lesson so they wouldn't do it again. ... However, as he got more like his old self, it was as if his old personality of what he was like before and his new character were mixing to create something else.'Who am I kidding? ... I'm just an angry person that's started to think more.' Peter thought as he was currently in the medical bay. ... Hoping to find some dead bodies. ... On the ship itself, there were even emergency caskets and some dead bodies that were kept just for Peter, but for some reason, he just couldn't bring himself to turn one of them. ... His hand was held on one of the handles for a while now.'I can't... ... I can't disrespect their bodies like that.' Peter thought as he walked off, trying to come up with some other idea. ... Logan's suggestion was to make Wights and explore what exactly he could do with them. ... In the past, Peter had often relied on his strength so much that he never bothered making Wights from the enemies he killed because they just wouldn't be much help to him. ... On top of that, even if he killed strong enemies, they just didn't seem helpful because what made them strong in the first place was their abilities. ... The two Wights he controlled would also constantly follow him around, which was a pain to him, and was why he would either use them as meat shields or forget about them. ... Muttering to himself was just hurting his head more when suddenly he stopped in his tracks. ... \"Wait, did I ever try toâ¦.. ... that might work. ... \"With the idea running in his head and not wanting to lose this momentum, Peter was seen running straight to a particular room. ... When he arrived, he could see all of the teleporters' in sight. ... \"Hey, which one of these teleporters head to planet Caladi? ... \" Peter asked the four or so guards that were in the room. ... All of them gulped as soon as they saw Peter. ... He already had a reputation for having a bad temper, one of the leaders they shouldn't get on the wrong side of. ... \"It's this one over here, sir! ... \" One of the men pointed. ... Seeing it, he smiled while walking over to the teleporter. ... \"Sir, do you have permission from Sam to use-\"\"Shut up! ... \" Where Peter's following words as he placed his hand on the man's face and pushed him away. ... \"I'll be back soon, so there's no need for me to get permission. ... \"With that, Peter had already gone into the teleporter and soon found himself in the Shelter on Planet Caladi. ... When arriving on the other side, the people there were also part of the Cursed faction, and they were also shocked to see Peter there. ... \"I know, I know, just tell Sam I won't be here long,\" Peter said, and next, using his amazing speed, he was running off in the distance and soon found himself out of the Shelter and in the desert standing on the sand. ... \"Where is itâ¦. ... where is it. ... \" Peter kept searching as he twisted and turned his head. ... Realising that just looking wasn't exactly going to help him out, he decided to just use his body's instincts instead.'This should work.'Following naturally where his body wanted him to go, Peter eventually found the place where the Cursed ship had crashed on planet Caladi, where so many people lost their lives. ... But not only humans had lost their lives. ... The area looked mostly cleared, with the human bodies taken away. ... Still, as for the Dalki bodies, they had remained, letting the sand cover them up or for the beast to take them away. ... Eventually, Peter started to dig in the sand at a specific spot and saw something dark and black. ... Grabbing onto it, he used his great strength to pull it out of the sand, and a mostly intact Dalki was seen. ... Its arms and limbs were broken.'When Quinn told us what the Demon tier amulet did, how he was able to control the Dalki and take down those motherships, it gave me an idea, maybe I can do the same. ... I can't bring back beasts. ... I know that much, but my powers let me turn vampires and humans into Wights. ... Dalki are half-human, so there's a chance this could work.'Placing his hand on the Dalki's chest, soon Peter something was felt leaving Peter's body, the veins on his arm were showing as the energy passed through his arm, they quickly popped out and went back in again once the energy passed. ... At that point, the Dalki's body started to move again, its body slightly healing from the lesser Wights effect, and soon it stood tall in front of Peter. ... \"Yesâ¦it worked! ... \" Peter cheered and was so excited that he slammed his fist into the Dalki's chest and punched its head clean soon after. ... It fell back in the sand and was unmoving again. ... \"Ahâ¦. ... well, I didn't want that one in the first place. ... \"Now realising his ability worked on Dalki, Peter started to dig through different parts of the sand again. ... Repeating the process as if he was looking for something, but not only was he looking for something, he was testing the limits of his ability as well. ... As a Wight, Edward, the ex vampire knight of the tenth family, told him that he had to protect his head at all costs. ... He could heal any wound as long as his head was kept intact. ... When he was turned by Quinn, Peter was on the verge of death but not dead, and as a ghoul, he still wasn't quite classified as an undead creature. ... Only when he turned into a Wight did his heart stop beating, so it made him wonder just what the lesser Wights he created were. ... In the first place, they were only able to be created from dead bodies. ... They were unable to use the abilities they had when they were alive but kept the same strength. ... They seemed a lot more like the typical zombies that one would know about from films, but did it really matter about their brain. ... Peter soon found out his answer that it didn't at all. ... For things had changed since the last time he had used the ability. ... Although he hadn't gone through an evolution, it seemed like the effects of his lesser Wights were more dependent on him.'It's just like Logan said, even my Wight powers are evolving with me.'Peter was looking at a Dalki that had lost its head which was now standing perfectly fine. ... It was a little strange, and Peter soon found out its limitations. ... The Dalki was able to heal wounds to a certain degree, just like Peter, but it couldn't regrow parts of its body that it had lost before it had been turned. ... On top of that, after enough damage to the body, unlike Peter, who could restore his regenerative abilities through eating flesh, they could not, and they would finally die, again. ... Essentially, they were like an item with durability but one that couldn't be repaired, so eventually, he needed to replace it with a new one. ... After many different tests, Peter still didn't give up, and that's when he finally found what he was looking for. ... Pulling out of the sand was a long sharp tail, meters long, and at the end of it were a pair of legs. ... However, the top half of its body was completely missing. ... \"This Dalki took way more of a beating compared to the others, but the bitch deserved it. ... \" Peter thought, hoping it would work. ... It only took a few moments for the smile to appear again, as he saw the legs standing there and the Dalki tail they were all afraid of swinging about. ... \"Your name was Slicer, right? ... I guess your bottom half belongs to me now. ... \" Peter smiled as he quickly started to run back to the base, with a half Dalki body running after him, keeping up. ... Of course, the lesser Wight Peter had created using the bottom half of Slicer's body wasn't as strong as her. ... For one, it didn't have its whole body, and none of the Dalki Peter had tested on before grew stronger the more blood they split. ... So it was similar to having half a Slicer with no power up, but the important part was her tail which was still intact. ... Entering the Shelter, the two ran straight back for the teleporters. ... Screaming was heard throughout the Shelter as people spotted the pair of legs and giant tail. ... \"It's alright, she's with me! ... The legs I mean! ... \" Peter shouted, still smiling. ... Because, now that he knew that a head wasn't needed for turning those into a lesser Wight, he knew exactly who the next person he was going to turn would be and no one would care how he disrespected this body.\n",

      "Thinking about what he was about to do next, Peter had a grin on his face that went from ear to ear. ... He was so pleased, but for those that did manage to catch the look on his face, it looked like a creepy smile rather than a pleasant one. ... His deep dark black eye sockets and pale skin didn't help for that matter. ... Peter ran through the Shelter with the legs and tail following behind him, causing quite the scene. ... The problem was, there really was no one who could do anything about it since they were moving so fast. ... The teleporter that Peter had come through could be seen ahead left on, and jumping through, he was back on the Cursed ship and soon to follow after him where the pair of legs. ... \"What the hell is that! ... \" The guard shouted. ... \"Those scales, and that tail, it's a Dalki body, I'm sure of it! ... Attack, attack! ... \"\"Don't attack! ... \" Peter shouted right after. ... \"Am I going to have to explain these legs everywhere I go? ... I mean, we have vampires and all sorts of things in the Cursed faction. ... Heck, Logan has a Dalki arm. ... I thought this wouldn't be too strange. ... \"Looking at them again though, even Peter had to admit it did look a little out of place. ... A Dalki was relatively large compared to a human, so even though it was just Slicer's legs, it nearly was as tall as a human itself, and a lot of the Cursed faction looked scared looking at the tail. ... \"Legs there is with me. ... \" Peter calmly said before everyone came raiding the room any second now to take on the Dalki. ... He could just imagine even Bonny and Void appearing out of nowhere. ... They always seemed to be around when the most interesting things were happening. ... A slight smirk appeared on his face as Peter imagined the news reports. ... \"Actually, do you mind doing me a favour? ... Report to Sam to come meet me, and then this way he can inform everyone to not be alarmed. ... Otherwise, all my hard work might be for nothing if everyone started to suddenly attack it. ... \"The guards looked at each other, thinking that Peter must have had a screw loose or something. ... The reason being, although they knew that Peter was most likely a V, they had no idea of his powers, and this was something that they didn't know they could do. ... Due to them not knowing about the subclasses within the vampire race. ... In the end, they decided to call Sam to the teleporter station immediately. ... They listened to Peter just because it looked like the Leg's and tail weren't attacking them or anything in the room. ... A little while later, Sam was seen appearing in the room, with Linda by his side. ... The only reason why he had brought her was because the men on the other end sounded a bit afraid and had told him to bring some back up with him. ... \"Come on, what could have Peter brought with him that would be just so-\"He couldn't even finish his sentence, as his eyes were set on the pair of legs in the room, which at this moment was sitting down, but the large tail could be seen swinging up at a height taller than a human. ... \"It's cool, right. ... I spoke to Logan, and he made me rack my brain a little, so I came up with this. ... \" Peter explained. ... For Sam, going through all the possibilities in his head, he had figured it out. ... It was clear that this was the bottom half of Slicer's Body. ... The fact that it wasn't attacking anyone and Peter was the one who had brought it, the most likely reason was it had something to do with his Wight abilities. ... \"This is good news,\" Sam said, carefully shuffling towards it, and stopped the second he had got within the range of the tail. ... When he saw Peter showing it was fine to get close, Sam moved forward, and Linda did the same. ... \"Her tail was the greatest strength of the Dalki. ... It was even able to cut through Hilston's Demon tier armour. ... This has to be a gold mine. ... We don't know if its strength is the same or its sharpness, but I would guess it has to be at a similar level. ... \"Hearing this, Peter had one more surprise for Sam and started to whisper in his ears. ... After listening to what Peter had to say, his eyes lit up even wider than before. ... \"1A, is the number,\" Sam said, and straight away, Peter was running off again. ... \"Legs follow and listen to Sam! ... \" Peter ordered. ... Using its tail, it gave off a salute by its waist since it had no head.'I guess I'm going to have to prepare an announcement.' Sam thought, looking at the thing. ... After getting the okay from Sam, Peter found himself in the ship's morgue. ... A very cold room, but for Peter, he felt no difference. ... There were several what looked like file cabinets with numbers in the corner of each of them. ... In the very corner of the room, Peter could see the number 1A. ... Unlike before, without hesitation, Peter was able to pull on the handle, and a body in a glass tube-like container was seen coming out. ... This was Peter's next turning target. ... The only thing was that it had no head, and the reason for that was Sil stepping on it, eradicating it.'I can only create two lesser Wights at a time, so why not have the two strongest we have ever seen before.' Peter thought. ... For the next person, he was ready to turn, was Hilston. ... No one, not even Sil would care what would happen to his body. ... In fact, the reason why it was in the morgue in the first place was so Peter could feast on it.'I'm going to have to explain to those guys when they come back, although, without your head, I'm not sure they will recognise you.' Peter thought, placing his hand on a healthy part of his chest after the glass container covering the body went away. ... He knew turning Hilston, he wouldn't be able to use his abilities like the others he had turned before, but Hilston was supernatural. ... Even without his beast gear, he had the speed and strength to match a low-level vampire lord. ... It was an amazing feat, something that seemed impossible. ... At the same time, if Hilston turned out to be somewhat weaker, then he imagined it was no loss on their part. ... Peter would take pleasure in using his body as a human meat shield. ... A few seconds later, after repeating the process, the body rose from the table it laid on. ... \"Haha. ... \" Peter chuckled. ... \"Oh, how I would love to punch you right now for that slap, you gave me, but there's no point. ... I know it's better to use you. ... \"With both pieces he needed, Peter was ready to put them into action, just like Quinn. ... Peter needed to figure out the best way to utilise his two lesser Wights in the middle of a fight while also using his powers. ... Still, for sure, Peter had now become a formidable foe that nobody would want to face. ... This was exactly what Sam was thinking as he was looking at Slicer at the moment.'Quinn, Leo, Erin, Layla, Sil and now Peter as well. ... These will be the key members of the Cursed faction in the future. ... Perhaps if Vorden and Raten evolve into Demon tier beasts as well. ... We might have a chance at winning this war after all.'On Blade island, currently, Vorden and Raten were trying to do just that. ... They were going around hunting for strong beasts, improving their skills, and gathering their crystals. ... There were also the beasts that had been captured that were at the legendary level underneath. ... Borden, and Sil were helping as well, but Sil not too much since the others didn't want him to help. ... As for Vicky, Pai and their mother and father. ... The four of them had decided to leave the island and do as they had said they would. ... To hunt down those Chained that had strong abilities and a chance in the future to disrupt and ruin the flow of everything. ... After all, without Turedream present, these were the type of ability users who had chucked the world into chaos before. ... For Eno, he was in his favourite spot, looking out from the castle at the whole island staring into space. ... All the preparation he wanted to do and needed to do was done. ... \"Sometimes I think of the past,\" Eno said. ... \"You know, I thought after all these years that I would learn to forget about the past, yet here I am. ... Brock, Do you think I'm evil? ... \" Eno asked. ... \"Evil sir is subjective,\" Brock answered. ... \"You should know that much by now, sir. ... We have both seen how history books from the humans and the vampires have been written. ... Sometimes people often put things in categories of good or bad, black and white. ... While others will say that there is a grey area. ... For me, I believe that there is just one colour. ... There is no right and wrong, there is just what people want to do, and you have always just followed what you wanted to do. ... \"After Brock's answer, there was silence from Eno until he finally spoke. ... \"It looks like he is finally making his move. ... We should prepare to call the others back. ... \"******\n",

      "Lately, Quinn seemed to have been travelling on a number of different surfaces. ... From hard barren rock, to unknown metals, snow, sand and even more. ... Right now, Quinn was experiencing yet another new terrain, as his two feet were in a swampy texture. ... The water rose up to the ankle of his boots. ... If he was to stay in one place too long, he would feel like his body was sinking on the spot, so he was constantly on the move. ... He also needed to be careful not to apply too much pressure for that would make him sink deeper as well. ... In a way, he found fighting on different terrain to be a form of training in itself. ... He never knew when and what terrain he would be fighting his enemies on, so it was good to have experienced all the differences. ... Fortunately, this planet also had a few places where the land was more solid, allowing him to rest. ... This was exactly what Quinn was currently doing. ... Around him were several trees that had long green vines dangling from them, so it was hard for one to see into the distance, not that there was anything nice to look at in the first place. ... However, Quinn was not alone either. ... Surrounding him were the Marked Dalki. ... Thanks to the power of the Demon tier Amulet, Quinn now had a total of four Dalki under his control. ... Three of them had two spikes on their bodies, while the last one, who had been the most recent captive, had only one for now. ... Quinn had considered marking a beast instead of a Dalki, but all the beasts he had encountered in the area were far weaker than even the one spiked Dalki, which made it seem pointless, especially since the amount of energy required to open up another slot was incredibly high at this moment. ... Failing to mark something, meant he would have to regather that energy once more. ... They had been killing beasts and Dalki for a while now, but the fifth slot still hadn't opened up. ... Quinn was starting to wonder if four slots were its limit, but the Vampire Lord believed the system would have said something if that would have been the case. ... Additionally, he didn't mind the process taking longer, since all this fighting was bringing the Dalki closer to evolving as wellThanks to his controlled Dalki, Quinn had discovered what incredible beings they actually were. ... Their bodies had similar healing capabilities to vampires. ... As long as enough time passed their wounds would naturally heal by using up their body's energy. ... Alternatively, they were also able to eat the beasts in the area to acquire more energy and to speed up this healing. ... However, if their bodies healed this natural way, it was also a sign that their strong energy they would get from being harmed had gone away as well, unlike when their wounds healed from bleeding out, which was something Quinn still couldn't wrap his head around. ... Losing blood, yet still healing from fatal wounds. ... No wonder the Dalki were so hard to kill.'Maybe it's time we move again.' Quinn contemplated. ... 'We've been on this planet for a while.'Quinn had chosen not to stay on one planet too long, neither did he want to attempt to take down another one of their mother ships for fear they would retaliate or send someone after him. ... The problem was moving from each planet took time, and as Quinn moved to each one he was spending more and more time on them.'The Dalki seem more spread out on this planet compared to the previous ones, so I think you should be fine to stay here a bit longer.' Vincent shared his opinion. ... 'Besides, I think things have calmed down a little. ... That being said, this also feels like the calm before the storm.'Looking at the Dalki, next to him, Quinn was looking at one of the two spikes, and all four of the Dalki standing still as statues around him like bodyguards, while he was sitting down with his back up against a tree.'Hey, I was thinking. ... You have been a big help when fighting with my body, but you're still not the best when it comes to making the most out of it. ... \" Quinn said. ... \"In an emergency I will have to flee by using my Shadow link skill, which might mean I'll be forced to leave the Marked Dalki behind or I'll probably have to drain their energy. ... I won't be fighting with the Dalki body like last time. ... \"'I'm hoping there is a point to you saying all of this, rather than just telling me my skills are bad in your body.' Vincent replied. ... \"What I was thinking, is maybe we can put you in a Dalki body? ... We could use Shiro's power. ... \" Quinn suggested. ... Originally, Quinn wanted to put Vincent in another Humanoid beast, but with the Dalki owning most of the beast planets now, that seemed quite improbable.'I don't think that is a good idea, Quinn.' Vincent replied after a while. ... 'We know Shiro's ability basically places one consciousness inside the body of another being, but the original still remains. ... Even if these Dalki are under the amulet's control, I doubt their consciousness is completely gone. ... It only worked so well for your friends because the beasts' minds inside had agreed to help.''Perhaps Shiro has a skill that can eliminate one of the minds, but even then if my mind is in the body of the Dalki, were you thinking of using one of your Marked? ... We don't know what will happen to me. ... I might also end up under the amulet's effect. ... Or think about what happens if you need to flee, and you might drain that body.''I'm also partly worried that moving me will disrupt the system.'Even if it doesn't, my existence might have been a coincidence, so moving me out means there is the possibility that I might not have any no way to return to the system either, if something has to go wrong with it. ... I know you mean well, but I just think that if we act now there are too many risks. ... Let's wait until this is all over.' That was the problem, Quinn honestly didn't know when this would 'all' be over, especially with things happening in the Vampire World now. ... Would it be when Jim was defeated? ... When Arthur no longer was a threat? ... Even then he still needed to worry about the Dalki, the Demon tier beast and Bryce. ... Not to mention his unresolved issues with Pure, who he was sure would eventually come to him since he had eliminated Agent 2 as well now. ... \"I'mâ¦getting a little tired just thinking about it. ... \" Quinn sighed, which was the first time Vincent had heard him say such words. ... Eventually a week had passed on the Cursed ship. ... As promised Leo had been training both Erin and Layla. ... Helping them use their Qi, as well as trying to unlock the soul weapons in both of them. ... What Leo didn't know was that Layla had also been doing her own separate training alongside Nate following their training sessions. ... After her loss with Erin, she had been more determined to work harder. ... Her training with Nate had mostly focused on her being able to access those emotions again and unlock the fourth form. ... What Nate hadn't realised when offering to help her was that their 'training' had been more on the lines of a therapy session rather than using one's fists which was what Nate was good at. ... He had asked Layla many times if she was sure that she wouldn't rather speak to someone else, who she might perhaps be closer to than him, but she had insisted that he was the easiest to talk to, for she felt like he would never judge her. ... According to her judgement, the only thing Nate cared about was girls and getting better at martial arts. ... Someone else might have been offended by that, but Nate had just shrugged it off, even going so far as to make a joke about Layla having seen right through to his core. ... One of the things the two had discussed was the warning that Leo had given on that first day. ... It was strange but all he had said was to be careful with the sword she was using. ... However, after learning that Quinn thought it would be fine for her to have the sword, Leo thought that it would be fine for now. ... Especially since she had already been using it for a while with no apparent problems. ... In the end though, Erin and Leo were soon to leave the Cursed ship. ... Their equipment was finally complete. ... Arriving in the forgery room, Alex and Andrew had naturally done their classic 'covering of the items with a cloth' trick. ... \"You do know that this is pointless for me. ... \" Leo said. ... \"For one, I can already see what they look like underneath the cloth, even though I do not know the colours, not that it makes much of a difference to me. ... \"After hearing that, Erin had decided to lift the cloth to reveal the items that they would now be using. ... \"Hey! ... \" Alex pouted. ... \"How could you steal the best part of this?! ... It's like opening up a package that you ordered online! ... Imagine coming home and finding out that someone else had opened your package. ... Or opened your presents on Christmas to still give you the present. ... It just ruins the feeling. ... \"Still ignoring him, Erin first went to look at the giant cover that had been built for her Demon tier weapon. ... It was designed to be strapped around her waist, and had straps over her shoulders while being placed on her back. ... The large piece was the perfect shape for the large sword. ... The three holes that were in the blade, the cover also had indents to show where they would be, not ruining the design and beauty of the demon tier weapon. ... \"After seeing you, I chose to go with a black and yellow design for the cover. ... \" Andrew explained. ... \"I was pretty sure the last time I saw you, you had black hair so I decided to go with that, but now I see you have blonde hair. ... \"Andrew thought his eyes were playing tricks on him but thought Erin must have just dyed it while she was staying on the ship, not realising that it was part of Erin's abilities. ... Although she could control the change at will now. ... \"Thank you, it is excellent. ... \" Erin was more than pleased with it. ... When placing the sword in the cover, she couldn't even see its energy with her ability. ... The suppression powers were more impressive than the chains she was wearing.'If the urge ever comes back in the future, I should seek out this forger to help me.' Erin decided at that moment. ... On Alex's table was Leo's weapon and Erin's Katana. ... It was time for Leo to find out whether or not his sword had been put to good use.\n",

      "It had been a while since Leo had received a new blade to use. ... He had trusted his cursed sword for so long and had always had it by his side. ... Although it wasn't the best blade for hunting beasts, he didn't need it to be, thanks to Leo's skills and his power of Qi. ... The main reason he kept the blade was due to the Curse that had been left behind in the weapon. ... He could feel the power of the sword rise with energy whenever he fought against the Dalki. ... If he had ever outright told people this, they would think he had gone mad. ... No one had heard of such a thing happening before, but it worked similar to a passive skill, only when going up against the Dalki. ... Which was why he also knew that it might be impossible for Alex to pass on this sort of thing when creating a new weapon. ... \"I think it's best if you picked it up,\" Alex said smiling, and Leo did just that, and when he did, he could tell instantly. ... \"I'm sorry to say, but if I pick that thing up myself, I think I wouldn't be able to work for the rest of the day. ... \" Alex chuckled. ... He was proud of his accomplishments. ... Although he didn't have the same ability as Leo or was as intune at sensing different types of Qi, he could tell that when creating the weapon with the Demi-god tier crystal, something had happened. ... Everything changed when he had melted down Leo's old sword. ... The power was still strong from it, and adding it to the new Demi-god tier weapon, he had created something he had never done so before. ... Leo picked it up, and it was nearly an identical weight to his last sword, but just as Alex said, the Curse didn't weaken. ... Instead, it was enhanced. ... The sword had a complete makeover in colour, as the hilt was black, and the sword had a wave pattern going along the metal. ... The bottom half is a dark purple with a bladed edge. ... \"I wasn't able to really touch the sword after it was complete. ... I wasn't joking about what I said earlier, so I'm not sure if it has an active skill or not. ... \" Alex said. ... Leo placed the sword away in the sheath he had. ... Since the blade was identical to his last one in size and shape, it fitted perfectly. ... He wouldn't test if it had an active skill or not for now, for he didn't know what It could do and would be afraid it could hurt others. ... There was no Quinn here, where one could use their inspect skill to find out weapons' active or passive skills. ... Finally, Leo had a Demi-god blade that could rival any weapon out there, and with his strength in Qi, he was sure he wouldn't lose out to Demon tier weapons either. ... The next blade that was placed on the table was also a katana style blade. ... It looked pretty regular for a blood weapon. ... Just leak a katana blade one would see any forger make. ... Though there were differences. ... If one was to look closely, in the middle of the blade was a single line that went all the way to the tip. ... It was clear to see through like glass. ... That's when Erin noticed there was something similar at the bottom of it as well. ... \"The details are due to it being a blood weapon,\" Alex explained. ... \"The sword fills up as more blood is inputted into the sword, and then as you use its powers more, you will see the blood draining down from the tip. ... Not all blood weapons have this, but I got the idea from seeing Fex's blood weapon. ... \"I think it's a good idea in a fight to know when you need to refill it, a bit like a car. ... \"It made Erin wonder. ... The sword worked from being filled with Human blood. ... They were informed that it also worked with Dalki blood. ... However, it did not empower itself with vampire blood. ... What about her own blood? ... After all, she was considered only half-vampire, perhaps her blood was different, but she had decided not to test that out in front of Alex, not that she didn't trust him, but she just didn't want to feel different, even amongst the other subclasses on the ship.'Even Alex now has another Blood fairy by his side, yet I'm the only Dhampir? ... What would happen if I tried to turn someone?' Shaking her head and placing the sword in her own scabbard, she tried to let such thoughts go out from her head. ... Having collected both of their weapons, they thanked Alex and Andrew for their creations. ... The two of them headed back to the teleportation room to finally head back to the Vampire world. ... \"Are you sure you don't want to say goodbye to Layla before we leave? ... \" Leo asked. ... \"No,\" Erin said. ... \"I see no point in saying goodbye because I believe we will be returning soon anyway. ... \"\"Well, let's just hope that not much has happened in the vampire world while we were away. ... The fact that Paul has allowed us to travel back there should be a good sign. ... \" Leo commented. ... Although he was thinking it could be a bad one as well. ... As it also could indicate that he needed their help. ... The two of them stepped through the teleportation heading back to the vampire world.ââA short while later, and Sam had learnt of the two of them having already headed back. ... He felt a little bad, for he had just missed the two of them. ... If they had stayed a little longer, they could have come on board for what he had planned next. ... For he had just received a bit of good news.'I guess the two of them will be okay without it anyway, and perhaps they are needed more over there.' Sam thought. ... Still, he would deliver the news to the rest of the Cursed leaders, as a meeting had been called in the command centre for all of them. ... Everyone arrived promptly, compared to how they would usually. ... With how things were, every one of them was prepared for an announcement that a fight was about to set off at any second. ... Sam could see this as everyone had a serious look for once on their face. ... \"Wow, I wish you guys were like this every time. ... You can relax, I guess you could say this is good news for you all. ... \" Sam smiled. ... \"As you know, Quinn had ordered all the high tier crystals to go to those that were hunting on the front line. ... Because of this, the Daisy faction had used most of the crystals for themselves to create beast armour and more. ... \"Next, Quinn wanted the forgers to also create equipment for themselves to protect themselves if there was another attack on the Cursed ship, just like there was one recently. ... On top of this, there is a crystal shortage so nearly all crystals gathered have to be stored and rationed out to the other Shelters. ... Because of all of this, the Cursed leaders have been lacking in the equipment department. ... \"So far, everything Sam had said just made it sound like there wasn't any good news at all, but the best news was to come. ... \"I just got a report from Vorden, who is on Blade island at the moment. ... Apparently, Hilston was keeping some pretty interesting things underneath his castle. ... It's been a long time since you got anything, so I thought it would be nice for all of you to upgrade. ... What I am suggesting is for the leaders of the Cursed group to head to the Blade island and get first pick on the equipment there. ... \" Hearing about this, there were some large smiles on some of their faces, Particularly Nate and others. ... They didn't really use beast weapons. ... So having a strong set of beast armour and items was vital. ... \"The beast equipment has already been forged. ... My guess is he properly also stripped some of the Chained and threw their equipment in there. ... So no one can complain about us keeping using crystals to make items, this is the best use for it, and then with the remainder of the items, we will hand them out to the rest of the crew. ... \"It certainly was good news for them all. ... Even Layla was pleased by this. ... She had a great weapon by her side, and her training was bearing fruit. ... If she had a new set of armour on top of this, she would grow even further. ... \"I do have one last thing to mention,\" Sam said before everyone got too excited. ... \"Everyone here will be going to the island, while Megan will be left in charge of the place. ... \"\"So you will be coming as well, Sam? ... \" Nate asked, thinking back to the last time the two of them could hunt or fight together side by side. ... \"Yes, including me, but there is a reason for this. ... Richard Eno believes that an attack is bound to happen soon, which is why I have also decided to send all of us to the island. ... With the teleporters back online, we can travel from there to here, but we also have to make sure that no one gets through those teleporters. ... \"If everyone understands, then let's get to it,\" Sam said with a smile, happy to finally be leaving the Cursed ship after a long time. ... Before they left, Peter cleared his throat. ... \"Ah, thats right,\" Sam said, struggling to get his words out. ... \"I do have to make everyone aware that you might be seeing a pair of legs and a headless man around... ... \"*******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "The Cursed leaders were pleased that for the first time in a long time all of them would be travelling together. ... It was usual for large parties to go out on expeditions, but in the past Sam had always asked for a team to stay behind, so they could protect the Cursed ship from attacks like the one just recently. ... However, Sam was predicting that something big was very likely going to occur on Blade Island in the near future and with most of the Cursed ship's former crew left behind on Caladi, it was no longer much of a target for their enemy. ... On top of that, Sam wanted to reward everyone's hard work by granting them first dibs on Hilston Blade's secret stash of treasure, so that everyone could find something suitable for themselves. ... Going through the teleporter, the group arrived. ... Unfortunately, the location of their arrival had already been set and it didn't take any time at all for everyone to freeze up. ... \"D-D-Dâ¦ DRAGONâ¦\" Wevil sniveled as he was pointing at the beast, his teeth chattering by the second. ... By Eno's will they had all arrived near the tablet, which also meant that it was next to its protector. ... Not all of them had the 'pleasure' of having met with a Demon tier Beast. ... Wevil and Linda had been there when Quinn had fought against the giant pink tree, but this one had a completely different feel to it. ... Sam wanted to tell them to calm down, but as someone who was still shaking at the mere sight of it, it was a hard message for him to convey. ... Eventually, after staying in the Dragon's presence without any incident for a while, the members of their expedition started to carefully move again. ... It helped that the beast appeared to be sleeping. ... At one point, probably reacting to their movement, it had briefly opened one of its giant eyes to take a quick look at the newcomers. ... Even those who had come here before, froze up when faced with the beast's attention. ... Fortunately, after taking one big sniff with its large snout, it simply closed its eye again. ... In total it had only paid attention to them for a few seconds, before it had chosen to ignore them. ... Still, it had been enough for many of them to see their life flash before them. ... \"Okay! ... \" Sam exclaimed, happy that he hadn't just ended up as a snack. ... However, he quickly turned around to the beast, afraid that he had just disturbed its rest, after realising that he had just shouted, but fortunately it just let out another snore. ... In a lower voice he said: \"Let's do a count to check that everyone is here. ... \"There were Peter, Layla, Logan, Fex who had a large box on his back that looked similar to a coffin, Nate, Wevil, Linda and of course Sam himself. ... Additionally, following behind Peter were Hilston's large muscular body, which still had a hole in its chest and was missing his head, as well as Slicer's bottom half which Peter just referred to as 'Legs'. ... It caused the others to naturally step away from Peter. ... When they had learned about what he had done, even the other leaders had regarded the Wight's action as more than a little crazy. ... All of them were worried about the consequences if Slicer's bottom half could at some point overcome the loyalty she was placed under. ... It would be a disaster if she would turn on them at some point. ... The reason for Peter's confidence was that he knew that he would never do anything to harm Quinn, so he was sure that his Lesser Wights had to share the same feeling towards him. ... Still, the others couldn't shake the uneasy feeling they got from Legs, afraid that he might have put too much trust in his ability. ... \"Peter, you might want to be careful when Sil and the others seeâ¦ 'that'. ... \" Linda pointed at Hilston's body, trying to caution him. ... \"Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if they attack your new creepy friends straight away. ... \" Fex agreed, keeping his eye on Legs' tail moving back and forth. ... It reminded him of an excited dog that was happy to be by its owner's side. ... He was only seeing it from the corner of his eye, but it was so annoying that the vampire just had to grab it to make it stop, but to his surprise he grabbed onto nothing but air.'What theâ¦ did that stupid tail just dodge me?!' Even more annoyed by his failure, Fex attempted to grab it again and again, but each time the tail moved faster, to the point the vampire got ready to use his string ability to slow it down. ... \"Stop that, gel boy! ... \" Peter growled at Fex. ... \"Legs belong to me now! ... I can't get another one, so don't ruin it! ... \"\"Alright, everyone settle down please. ... We're all here now, but where is Dennis? ... He was meant to be meeting us. ... \" Sam wondered, looking around the place. ... While they were waiting for their pickup to collect them and take them to their destination, Wevil and Linda found another interesting thing when they walked towards the centre of the open space. ... \"Hey isn't that.. ... \" Wevil was still feeling uneasy because of the sleeping Dragon, but now there was another thing that he felt he should be worrying about. ... \"Yeah, I'm sure of it. ... It looks almost identical to the Demon tier beast that was on the Graylash planet. ... \" Linda gulped down hard. ... The two of them were too afraid to get too close, but they did notice that it was far smaller than the one they had seen. ... Eventually, a gust of wind was felt on all of their faces from a distance, and quite a large one at that, and that's when they could see a black furred creature arriving in front of them all. ... \"It's good to see you again. ... \" Vorden greeted them. ... Currently sitting on his back was Dennis, who quickly climbed down, holding a hand to his mouth. ... \"How could those kids like this type of ride? ... I think I'm going to thro-. ... \" Before he could even finish his sentence, he hurled over. ... Poor Dennis hadn't accounted for the fact that Vorden had played with the kids before his evolution. ... As a Legendary tier beast his wind powers and speed had improved dramatically. ... Unless he held back, Vorden was sure that the kids would also be unable to handle the kind of speed he used to get here. ... At first, Vorden was all smiles as he looked at everyone, until his eyes landed upon the headless body. ... \"What is that?! ... \" Vorden questioned, his eyes turning to slits. ... \"You're going to have to be more specific, you wanna know more about Legs, or the headless one? ... \" Peter asked casually. ... While Sam was explaining the situation to Vorden, Layla who was at the back of the group was more concerned about something else. ... Ever since she had set foot on the island, the black sword by her side had been violently shaking.'What's wrong with it? ... Is it reacting to the Dragon? ... Or is it because of the strange tree?' Layla wondered. ... Putting this to the test, she started to walk towards the two, but the second she stepped towards the Demon tier beast, the shaking of the blade lessend. ... She was pleased that the sword wasn't reacting to the Dragon, because truth be told she didn't want to get closer. ... When walking towards the tree she expected something to happen as well, but there was nothing on that end either. ... Then, heading back towards one last thing, she finally noticed.'So it seems to react to the tablet? ... â¦ Will something happen if I touch it?' Layla thought, unsure whether she should test it out or not. ... ââWhile the Cursed faction were busy on Blade Island, Owen along with his Graylash faction were currently the busiest of the three groups in the war against the Dalki. ... Although they had agreed to not go on a full force attack, Owen and his people were successfully winning every single skirmish they were coming across. ... This was mainly due to the planet they were on. ... There were dark clouds above them, which would pour constant rain on the planet. ... More importantly with these types of conditions it tremendously boosted the elemental powers of lightning. ... On the ground, there had been news of another small camp having been set up. ... Owen could see it up ahead, and he didn't have the others by his side.'Any Dalki we take down now, will be one less we will have to worry about later on.' Owen thought, as he struck thunder bolts into the clouds above where the Dalki had set up, and soon lightning started to strike down at the Dalki in their small camp. ... It looked like there were twenty of them in total. ... With this first attack, he soon charged in like a lightning bolt himself, but he wasn't alone. ... He and his partner entered the sloppily built small camp and immediately got to work, firing off their powers, aiming at the Dalki's vital points, finishing them with their great strength. ... The Dalki in the camp didn't even have time to react and after ten minutes, all twenty or so Dalki had been defeated. ... \"If I counted correctly you got twelve while I finished eight. ... You really have improved, little Owen. ... \" An old man dressed in white robes said. ... \"I'm happy that there is someone in the family that can challenge me a little. ... \" Owen happily accepted the praise. ... After all it came from Grim Graylash, his grandfather and the previous leader of the Graylash family. ... \"I'm happy that my genes seem to have merely skipped a generation. ... When your father grew up and didn't show much promise in regards to our ability, I was worried for the Graylash family, for what would happen when Hilston would take me away, but I see I didn't have to worry at all. ... \"It looked like Owen now owed Quinn another favour for returning someone who was important to him. ... With the two of them, they were able to take out camps and scout groups just by themselves, a feat that was giving a massive morale boost to those in the Graylash family. ... It was then that the two of them received a message. ... \"Sir, this is Hermes reporting. ... We have spotted the one you were looking for, not too far from the Shelter, and it looks like the Dalki are ready for a full force attack. ... Please come back immediately! ... \"With their powers, the two of them could move fast, so getting back in time wasn't a problem, but the message hadn't ended there. ... \"Sir, a warning. ... The Dalki you fought before seems to have returnedâ¦ however it appears to be a five spike now. ... \"At the same time, Eno, who had been doing nothing but waiting for the Cursed faction's arrival, finally stood up. ... \"Brock, it's time for you to call Quinn. ... Tell him to come back immediately. ... Jim is making his move. ... \"*****You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Vorden led the Cursed group to the underground storage place that was located underneath the castle. ... Surprisingly, the beasts that would usually be loud as one would go down the elevator remained silent. ... Coming down, nobody else was present at the moment, which Vorden took as a good thing, because he was hoping to explain things to the other three before they reacted to seeing a certain headless person. ... When walking through the dark tunnels, they went past several large cells that used to have beasts inside them, but instead they were filled with other things. ... \"Whoah, are all of those beast crystals? ... Didn't Sam say that Hilston didn't keep any in his storage? ... \" Fex asked, amazed not just by the number of them but the quality as well. ... Truth was, Sam was also curious about that. ... He had just told the others what he himself had been told. ... \"That's because those aren't Hilston's crystals. ... Those are crystals all of us have collected from the beasts we've killed. ... \" Vorden explained. ... Now Sam understood a bit more since he knew that both Raten and Vorden could evolve. ... They must have been gathering the crystals to use them when they had enough to evolve.'If I remember correctly, after consuming each crystal there is a waiting period for the beast body to evolve, this is also when they are at their weakest and most vulnerable. ... I guess Vorden and Raten decided that they would take all the crystals in one go to minimise this risk, but I wonder if that means the time to absorb all the crystals energy will be longer as well.' Sam thought to himself. ... When they finally entered the main room, they all stood there for a few seconds as they looked over heaps and heaps of beast equipment. ... Just a small percentage of all those weapons, armours would be enough to make the other factions go crazy, but here they were, just sitting there like piles of trash. ... To their collective surprise, the first person to make a move was Fex. ... He ran over to one pile and started to sort through it. ... \"Hey what is he doing? ... \" Linda asked. ... \"I can't believe he was faster. ... \" Wevil mumbled as he activated his transformation, turning his body partly into the tiger beetle, which focused on speed. ... \"Remember what Sam said? ... Everything is first come, first serve! ... \"Before Linda could say anything, Wevil was already on top of another pile of equipment and started to search for the best one there. ... Sam just began to shake his head, elated that neither Bonny nor Void were here for this scene would severely damage their reputation.'Why are they behaving like this? ... They should know that all of them specialise in different weapons! ... Is this really my fault for believing they would act better than wild animals?' Sam wondered, as he watched Wevil and Fex both pull on the same armour, both of them wanting to try it out. ... Ultimately, he let out a sigh and decided to join in looking for new equipment as well. ... During the following thirty minutes, all of them were busy testing out the loot. ... Even if it wasn't their weapon of choice, many would be swinging swords, bashing other items against each other, checking for active skills and more, until a few more people had entered the cave. ... \"All of you're a bunch of kids! ... \" Raten shouted, after watching them uncontrolled. ... At that moment, Vorden and the others stopped what they were doing. ... Only Peter, and his two helpers had completely ignored who had just entered. ... \"Peter! ... \" Linda called out. ... Hearing his name, he turned his head, and his two helpers did the same. ... \"What the fu-\" Raten was about to curse. ... but he too quickly turned his head thinking that another person would have a worse reaction. ... All eyes were looking towards Sil. ... Strangely, Sil had almost no reaction at all when looking at the body and justâ¦ greeted the others. ... \"It's nice to see you all. ... \"They wondered if Sil hadn't registered Peter's Lesser Wights, but it seemed impossible. ... Sil had even looked over at the body a couple of times, but there was no anger, no aggressiveness or anything from him at all. ... \"Sil... ... are you alright with this? ... \" Vorden eventually asked, coming over to him, and looking in the direction of the headless body. ... \"Although that thing looks like Hilston, I know it's not him. ... He's deadâ¦ I've made sure of it. ... If anything, seeing his headless body walk around, taking orders from Peter of all people, I feel relieved. ... It's further proof that Hilston will never come to haunt us. ... \" Sil explained. ... Raten and Vorden looked at each other, both feeling the same thing. ... Their little brother had really grown up. ... For the first time, Sil was the most reasonable out of the three, his words alleviating their own doubts. ... The group continued to look through the equipment, their former fervor cooling down as they began to help each other out by looking for some treasures underneath. ... Borden, who was in his small form and had great strength, was especially well suited for this task. ... Eventually, Sam, who wasn't too picky in this department, decided on a mismatch of Legendary and Emperor tier equipment at which point he stopped looking. ... It was tiring trying all the equipment out. ... Sometimes it was hard to tell what tier they were at without wearing them, so Sam had just chosen the ones he had felt had granted him the best stats, rather than something with strong active skills that suited him. ... While getting out of everyone's way, he suddenly received a call coming from none other than Sach. ... \"Sam, I don't have much time to speak, but I'll be sending you a file that will update you on all the information. ... \" Sach informed the other as soon as the call had been answered. ... \"In essence, the Graylash faction is about to be attacked by a Dalki army led by a five spiked Dalki. ... \"\"What's more, it seems like One Horn is finally making his moves as well. ... This is not a message asking for your help. ... I trust you will do whatever is best, but I also remember Eno's words during the meeting that he was relying on us to defend Blade Island. ... Unfortunately, I'm afraid we won't be able to while being tangled up in this. ... \"Hearing all of the information, Sam had one question on his mind. ... \"What about the Cursed faction planets? ... How are Helen and the others coping? ... \"\"So far, theirs is the only side that shows no signs of movement. ... \" Sach reported. ... \"For further details, please read through the reports. ... I'm sorry, but I have to go now. ... \" Sach ended the call.'The Dalkiâ¦they have started to attack the other sections but haven't attacked the Cursed faction yet. ... There are two things I can think of. ... Either one of the Dalki leaders is on their way here to Blade Island while the other two are busy, trying to hold up our forces, or that Slicer was originally meant to lead the attack but her death ruined their plans.'Either way, Sam thought at least they still had time as Blade Island was in no such trouble at the moment. ... This did make him feel bad for the other groups, wondering if each one could handle a five spiked Dalki on their own.'Should I inform Quinn? ... This seems like a decision he should make, whether we should help one of the two groups?' Sam hesitated. ... It was then that one more person entered the cave. ... Hearing the footsteps Sam immediately turned his head, only to find Brock walk in with his hands behind his back. ... \"You appear to have just been updated on the current situation outside. ... \" Brock noted. ... \"I can guess what you must be thinking, but it's not a good idea to decrease our own force at this moment. ... Remember what Eno said. ... If they get their hands on the Demon tier beast, this war is basically lost. ... \"\"Think, why would they have started attacking those places but not here yet? ... If I were them, I would let some time pass, pressuring my enemy to send over some help and the second they do, that's when I would strike this place. ... \" Sam didn't like it but Brock's argument made sense. ... In the past, they might have doubted the Dalki's strategic capabilities, but them attacking all the planets at once, had proven that humanity had been wrong to underestimate them in this regard. ... Nevertheless, Sam felt bad knowing that lives were being lost while they were just waiting on Blade Island, protecting what felt like an almighty beast of all things rather than their fellow people. ... The only good news was that their Cursed faction weren't under attack. ... If they were, then they would probably have to move at least some of the group that was currently with them. ... \"I have come here to tell you that Eno claims we need Quinn. ... Please contact him and tell him to come back to the island right now. ... \" Brock delivered the message needed. ... Sam also didn't like the way he was being talked to, but for the greater good he swallowed his displeasure down. ... Even with all of them there, Richard Eno still seemed to be worried and knowing that old man there had to be a good reason behind that. ... \"So Quinn that's all the information I have, Eno wants you to return to the island now and by now I think he means straight away, but it's up to you to decide what you want to do. ... \" Sam reported, leaving the decision for Quinn to make.******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Quinn felt like it was a good thing he was relaxed and still sitting by the swampy tree when he had received the message, because it certainly was something he wanted to take his time to think about instead of rushing over head first. ... Fortunately, although Eno seemed adamant for Quinn to come as soon as possible, according to Sam nothing had happened on Blade Island yet. ... Right now, only the other two groups were involved in fights.'There are two actions I could take next.' Quinn started to list his options. ... 'I could go back right now by using my Shadow ability. ... That way I'll be by their side, could help them make preparations and could also find out why Eno wants me back so badly.''Alternatively, I could just continue training here with the Marked Dalki until the last second. ... If I'm lucky, it will allow me to open up a fifth slot from the Demon tier Amulet, so I can be as strong as possible when they do need me.'It was troublesome since both options had their upsides and downsides. ... Especially when thinking back to how strong the five spiked Dalki were. ... Quinn just wasn't sure if he was ready yet. ... Nevertheless, Quinn leaned towards heading back now, yet he didn't exactly enjoy being on Eno's call. ... It made him feel as if he was just another one of Eno's chess pieces in this entire war.'If you want my opinion, I also think we should go back now, so we can prepare with Eno and the others. ... I don't like him either, but there is a reason behind everything he does and his goals coincide with our own.' Vincent reasoned. ... Mulling over it for a little while longer, Quinn eventually stood up as he had come to a decision.'You're right, I'll head back to Blade Island, but not because of what you said.' Quinn insisted. ... 'I can take the Dalki with me, by putting them in my shadow space, and then use my Shadow link, I doubt even Eno knows that I am able to do this, so I'll keep them as my trump card for now. ... \"'I will need to use their strength and drain them anyway, if we run into something like another five spiked Dalki, after all. ... Besides, Sam said that nearly everyone is already on Blade Island. ... If I delayed my return trying to get stronger, and anyone were to die, it would be solely my own fault.'Of course, Vincent was happy with Quinn's answer. ... Honestly both options seemed fine, but he was happy that Quinn still had kept this part of him, the one that cared about his friends more so than anything and he hoped that would never change. ... It was finally time for Quinn to return to his friends' side. ... Using his Shadow link, he looked for someone he could connect to. ... While doing this though, there was something else Quinn noticed.'His... ... Shadow is activated at the moment? ... Does that mean he's using it as well?' Quinn could feel someone else's shadow being used, and it wasn't anyone from the Cursed faction. ... This was a big distraction for him, but he decided to shake it off for now and stick to the task at hand, if anything it meant Quinn needed to be more cautious. ... After connecting to Dennis, Quinn's body started to sink in the shadow.'I should train the Shadow link skill more and level it up, maybe then I can bring others with me as well, without having to use the Shadow lock skill.' Quinn thought as he could only see darkness around him. ... One moment all he could see was darkness, the next he was greeted by a bright blue sky, with white fluffy clouds and a certain clean smell. ... It had been a long time since Quinn had been on Earth, and the other beast planets just didn't have the same atmosphere as their home planet. ... Closing his eyes, Quinn sniffed the air, taking in the smell that he had missed. ... \"I see you are as relaxed as ever. ... \" The voice that spoke up immediately soured his mood, and when Quinn opened his eyes he could see Eno in front of him. ... Next to him was Brock and it looked like they were all standing on top of the castle wall. ... \"Quinn, you look good! ... \"\"Welcome back Boss. ... \"\"Hey, there he is! ... \"Turning around, Quinn acknowledged the greetings from the Cursed group with a nod. ... To his surprise nearly all of them were wearing beast gear he had never seen before. ... Quickly using his Inspect skill, Quinn could see the impressive gear that was on all of their bodies. ... That's when he also noticed that some of them weren't there as well. ... \"Where are the Blades? ... \" Quinn asked, looking around. ... Sam was the first to go up to Quinn, hoping to catch him up on what was happening so far, and what they were about to do. ... \"Since you didn't reply back straight away, we thought you might have decided to arrive some time later. ... \" Sam explained as he looked towards Eno and Brock who waited for the two of them, yet the old man's tapping foot made it clear that he wanted them to hurry up. ... \"So I kinda gave them the go ahead to start Eno's plans without you. ... \"\"Although Eno insists that the attack will happen soon, we have no clue when exactly. ... That's why we made the decision to send Sil back so he can gather the powers he needs. ... We will call him as soon as the fighting starts here. ... \"The big downsides of the Blade ability was that it required people with abilities and that the copied abilities only lasted for twenty four hours. ... Unfortunately, vampires didn't count, yet one thing they wanted to avoid was bringing people over who could act like the Chained for Sil's usage. ... Taking anybody to Blade Island would just be too dangerous. ... \"As for the other two, knowing what is about to come, Raten and Vorden are in the middle of consuming the beast crystals. ... You know about their bodies getting weak after doing so, which is why Borden is protecting them underground in the storage place just in case anything is to happen. ... \" Sam explained. ... With Sam having told Quinn everything, Eno came forward, cleared his throat to say his piece. ... \"This time, I have no master plan. ... I don't even know who exactly our foe will be, whether it will just be Dalki, Vampires or perhaps a mix of both. ... Naturally, I don't know their exact numbers either. ... I could give you some estimations we have, but if you rely on that it might just backfire. ... As such, it seems better to not share any flawed information and just prepare for the worst, which is what I will be doing now. ... \"\"What we need to concentrate on, is the things we do know. ... The Dalki are after the Demon tier beast. ... It prefers to stay near the giant tablet. ... At all costs we'll have to protect these three things in order of priority. ... The Dragon, the Tablet and finally the teleporter. ... \"\"All three of them are located at the centre of the island, close to each other. ... However, this is a good and a bad thing. ... Good, because our last line of defense will be here, without the need to split up. ... Bad, because it also means that before that we can be attacked from all directions. ... In essence, the whole island will be our battlefield. ... \"\"Look at the people who are here right now. ... I know we have requested help, I have even called for help on my side, but it's quite possible that we will have to deal with everything with just the people who are here right now. ... Keep that in mind. ... \"\"Another thing we can't really influence will be the Dragon's reaction when it senses so many invaders coming here. ... If the situation arises when you'll have to ask yourself 'Do I sacrifice my life for the Demon tier beast?' I want your resolve to be 'Yes!'. ... If the Demon tier beast gets taken, then all of the human race is doomed. ... \"The others heard this and looked at each other. ... They knew of the importance of this task, and every time they had fought they had done so with their lives on the line, but usually they could see the faces of the people they were protecting. ... As for Quinn, he didn't agree with this at all. ... \"What the hell kind of pep talk was that, Eno?! ... I understand that we should do everything we can to stop them from taking the Demon tier beast, but how is us dying going to help anyone?! ... If it comes down to it, we should live to fight again another day! ... \"\"If that's really your resolve, then they have practically already succeeded in taking the Demon tier beast! ... \" Eno sighed. ... \"How can you still underestimate the significance of this thing? ... You might not be ready to give it your all, but I can guarantee you, at least the Dalki will pay any price they have to, to make sure they get it into their hands! ... \"\"Then what about you? ... Do you have that resolve? ... Are you prepared to risk your own life for once?! ... How dare you ask my people, my friends to risk their life if you aren't prepared to do the same?! ... \" Quinn shouted. ... \"Who says I'm not? ... \" Eno replied, as he placed his hands together and a red glow could be seen.*****You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Quinn wasn't quite sure what was about to happen next. ... The red glow in between Eno's hands started to get brighter and brighter, until it was as bright as a flashlight, blinding them all. ... They had no choice but to look away, especially the vampires whose eyes were far more sensitive to the change in brightness.'Is this it? ... Has Eno finally snapped and revealed his true colours?' Quinn was ready to protect his friends. ... Activating his shadow, he was ready to summon the Dalki as backup. ... There was one thing that Quinn worried about, he had yet to see Eno's full strength and given his powerful ability that was free to do so many things he had to be cautious. ... However, the only thing that happened was that the light started to fade, revealing Eno. ... However, he looked completely different compared to just moments ago. ... His whole body was covered in a dark red armour and on top of his head there was what looked to be a type of crown. ... It was a thin band that went all the way round through his hair, yet it had three red spikes sticking out. ... The one in the middle was the largest and resembled a horn with the way it pointed upwards.'Is thatâ¦ is that the Blood armour?' Was Quinn's immediate thought. ... In the past, Quinn had seen Arthur in Blood armour when he had fought Hilston, although back then the Punisher hadn't used it against his foe. ... \"... ... how? ... Wasn't there only meant to be two sets of Blood armour in existence? ... One that belongs to the King-\"\"And the other to the Punisher Arthur. ... \" Eno cut Quinn off. ... \"I'm surprised you're that knowledgeable about our history, but there are still things that you don't know about this world. ... I was the First King of our vampire society. ... I was the one that decided that the Punishers should be created and I am the one that is prepared to act! ... If no one else will put their life on the line to stop this vampire, then I will! ... \" Eno proclaimed strongly, his aura having taken a regal tone thanks to his new outfit. ... Quinn had been paying close attention to the other's heart rate ever since he had donned the armour, studying his facial expression to see if there was any hint of hesitation, but there had been no signs that Eno had been lying. ... The thing Quinn still couldn't understand was why someone so old was prepared to risk their life more than he himself was. ... Not only had Eno apparently told them the truth, but he hadn't even shown any hesitation whatsoever than he had claimed to be ready to lay down his own life for the cause. ... Nevertheless, Quinn couldn't help but be suspicious. ... For someone who has lived for as long as Eno had, it wouldn't surprise him if he had either learned or come up with some trick to hide all these signs. ... Years to become a good enough actor, to control his heart beat so it wouldn't flutter, or perhaps lying on the spot was something that was just second nature to him.'A third Blood armour setâ¦ I never heard of such a thing. ... How I wish I could have studied it in my time...' Vincent noted. ... As a former researcher whose passion it had been to look into things, his passion about the vampire's past had blessed him with great knowledge. ... Yet even he had never heard of such a thing. ... 'Say what you will about Eno, but I have to admire his ability to have a backup plan for everything.'Point in case, Quinn had never been part of Eno's equation in the first place. ... The Vampire Lord was someone completely outside his expectations who had continued to defy common sense and any expectation the Original Vampire had for him. ... He could have easily left everything to Quinn and the Cursed faction, something he had done often enough in the past, yet Eno was now ready to risk his own life. ... Still, Quinn couldn't agree with the words that were said before. ... \"I'm sick of it. ... I'm tired of it. ... \" Quinn shouted again. ... \"I'm tired of people who think they know better, who are stronger, making decisions for others. ... We have our own lives, the people we care about our own decisions. ... Eno, you might think differently because of how long you have lived. ... You look at not just humans, but even me who is a vampire like a child. ... A child who is naive and hasn't lived through what you have so they need to listen to what you have to say. ... \"\"I won't deny that. ... \" Eno shrugged, before shaking his head. ... \"How can I not, when after all this time that has passed, everyone keeps making the same mistakes? ... It's my job to correct them. ... \"Not having any more words to say to Eno directly, Quinn decided to leave the area to calm down. ... He could tell that there were no amount of words that would change how the other would think. ... At the same time, he didn't know why he had gotten so frustrated. ... Was it because he was tired? ... Quinn felt like not just him but the whole Cursed faction had already been pushed to their limit far more times than should be reasonable. ... Or was it the fact that Eno was right, but he just didn't want him to be? ... Eventually walking away, hoping to calm down, no one knew what to say. ... They had felt Quinn's frustration many times during the war. ... \"Quinnâ¦\" Sam murmured, but decided that now was not the right time to approach him, and wanted to hear if Eno had anything else to say about the enemy or this plan. ... However, there was one person that hadn't thought about her actions, instead chasing after Quinn as soon as he had left and that was Layla. ... Following him through the castle, down to the top floor, and was now in the throne room, she could see Quinn up ahead mumbling to himself under his breath. ... \"Quinn, wait! ... \" She shouted, yet the Cursed faction leader seemed to be in his own world. ... He continued to go down the floors, making his way out of the castle.'Quinn, you can't be the perfect person all the time. ... You have to let your frustration out sometime.' Vincent tried to pacify his grandson. ... 'I was frustrated for many years, living in the vampire society, seeing other people not acting, thinking everything was okay when it wasn't, but you are not that type of person.''You never have been, that's why you decided to act. ... I think your frustration comes from seeing no end in sight, but trust me all of this will be over at one point.'Eventually, Quinn had left the castle. ... Without any plan where to go, he just headed straight. ... Vincent's words helped, but Quinn didn't know why Eno was just able to rub him the wrong way.'It's that look, that look in his eyes whenever he speaks to us. ... Like he doesn't care about any of our lives. ... Does he not care for anyone, but then whyâ¦. ... why does he risk so much for humans if he doesn't care. ... I just don't understand!' Quinn thought. ... \"Quinn! ... \" Layla called out again, and this time he had heard, turning around, seeing her slightly out of breath from chasing him. ... Luckily Quinn wasn't really running otherwise Layla would have never been able to catch up to him. ... \"Finally. ... \" Layla stopped next to him, huffing and panting. ... \"I just wanted to say, thank you. ... \" Layla said, once she had caught her breath back. ... \"I know you said those words because you care about us. ... You don't want any of us to risk our lives and trust me we don't. ... I'm not sure about the others but I'm sure their thoughts are along the same lines as mine. ... \"\"Even though we are tired, even though we don't want to risk our lives, at the end of the day, we decided to pick up our feet and continue on. ... Because if we didn't then who would take our place. ... If we don't protect Blade Island, then who else is there? ... \"These words were exactly the thoughts that Quinn had time and time again, after making his own faction. ... It was what kept him going in. ... If he didn't change the way the system worked then who would. ... Who could take his place, and who could stop the Dalki race. ... \"Thanks, Layla. ... \" Quinn smiled. ... \"You know, from the very beginning you have always been there for me, even when I was scared after just having turned into a vampire. ... Sometimes I need help, and not just with things to do with fighting, and you seem to be there at the right time to pick up the pieces. ... \"Layla smiled back as she started to remember those days. ... Things seemed so complicated even back then, but now they looked like child's play in comparison. ... She would have done anything to go back to that time and just spend some leisure time with each other at school. ... As the two of them looked into each other's eyes, the scabbard that Layla's sword was in started to rattle. ... It did so much that Quinn could even see it shaking. ... \"That swordâ¦\" Quinn looked at it. ... He then remembered something. ... When he had used his inspect skill on the sword it had triggered one of the Quests. ... \"Ah this thing, I actually want to ask you about it. ... \" Layla remembered, taking it off her side and holding it in her hand. ... She then pointed it in the direction of the tablet and the sword started to shake even more. ... \"It seems to be reacting to the tablet. ... \"'That's right, the tablet and the words both activated the quest to learn more about the Talen family. ... What will happen if I bring the sword to the tablet?'\"Do you mind, if I borrow the sword for a second? ... \" Quinn asked. ... Seeing no problem with that request, Layla handed the sword over to Quinn and the two of them headed towards where the tablet was. ... Hopefully, Quinn would learn more about his Talen family which he still had no clue about. ... He knew about his vampire side, but what was so special about the Talen name? ... However, when Quinn had reached the area where the Demon beast and tablet lay, he saw something else that shocked him even more. ... \"What theâ¦ is that from the little seed I planted?! ... \"Seeing the tree, the amulet around Quinn's chest started to react.*****You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "When Quinn had defeated the Demon tier beast, he had not only received the crystal from the beast but also other rewards alongside it. ... One of them had been a little seed. ... Unfortunately, the system hadn't told him what the seed was, or what it could be used for. ... Due to the lack of that knowledge, Quinn had been cautious about the seed. ... His first association had been that it was very likely a seed of the tree itself, hence why he had refrained from planting it where there were plenty of people such as on the Cursed ship.'Calm down, even if that really is a sapling of that damn tree, that's a good thing, right?' Quinn tried to stay positive, just like the last time. ... 'Although I'd rather not have to go through such a tough fight again, I have become stronger since then, so I should be able to defeat it. ... With another Demon tier crystal we'll be able to make another Demon tier item.'However, looking at the Dragon that was snoring not too far from the tree, a horrid thought entered Quinn's mind. ... What if the tree was already marking Beasts around the island? ... The parent tree had the ability to further enhance the power of those Marked. ... What if it could manage to mark the Dragon? ... The Demon tier was already strong and with the power of another Demon tier, it would practically be unstoppable!'Come to think of it, could that really happen? ... I'm sure the Dragon's power is far stronger than the tree and if it tries to take over, wouldn't the Dragon just destroy it?' Quinn wondered. ... Regardless, at the end of the day, Quinn had planted the seed on the island and whatever was to come would be his fault. ... The tree itself was currently around the same height as two humans stacked on top of each other. ... It was nowhere near as grand as the original, so Quinn was confident of being able to get rid of it, in case it showed any signs of making trouble, before it would fully grow. ... And there was one more concerning thing, the amulet around his neck. ... Moving forward, Quinn walked out towards it, and just like Layla's sword that would rattle now his amulet was shaking as well.'Before I get any closer I should do that.'[Inspect][An incomplete Roseus tree][No other information found]Other than the name of the tree, it looked like the system wasn't going to help him out now, but he had learned one thing, that it was incomplete.'Why does the system classify it as 'incomplete'? ... It can't just be because it isn't fully grown. ... It has to be missing somethingâ¦ has it yet to grow a crystal perhaps? ... Waitâ¦ could it be that it's somehow unable to?'Having warned Layla to stay back for now, Quinn handed her the sword back, while he himself inspected the tree from top to bottom. ... Unable to find anything, he went forward, but since nothing happened, Quinn eventually placed his hand on the tree. ... At that moment, the amulet was no longer shaking, rather it lit up. ... Using his Qi energy, Quinn tried to sense its energy. ... Unsurprisingly it had the energy of a beast running through it. ... It was clear this was a beast like the last one, yet he could sense no beast crystal inside.'The amulet is reacting to it pretty crazy, but maybe it's just because they both came from the same source.' Quinn contemplated, yet there was another thought in his head. ... 'Shouldn't this be a reward for killing the Demon tier beast? ... This tree came from the seed I planted, and up until now the system has never given me something that could harm me directly.'Thinking things through, Quinn used his Inspect skill again, only this time he did so on the Demon tier Amulet. ... It gave him the same information about the skills and its uses as before but there was one additional line that hadn't been there previously.[The Demon tier Amulet can also be used as a key]It had only come up now after discovering the tree, putting this and the fact that the seed was meant to be a reward, Quinn took off the amulet and was ready to press it against the tree. ... When it was a few inches away his hand stopped.'What if I can't get the key back after putting it in the tree? ... What will happen to the Dalki in my Shadow lock? ... Will I no longer be able to use its abilities?'Considering that scenario, Quinn also thought about the five spiked Dalki that had defeated him. ... Even if he were to suck all the Marked Dalki dry, the power boost alone would not help him defeat that one. ... As impressive as Eno appeared in his Blood Armour, Quinn doubted that teaming up with him was enough, either. ... With these thoughts he pushed the amulet in, and soon he could feel the amulet being sucked out of his hand, and burning into the tree. ... Letting go, the amulet started twisting and turning and lighting up with the tree, and the leaves on the very top started to sprout even more. ... In front of Quinn's and Layla's very eyes the tree was growing wildly, the ground cracked underneath as its roots were digging in, but the amulet could still be seen.'Damn it, I seem to have made a mistake!' Quinn bit his bottom lip, but finally the growth spurt stopped. ... The tree had doubled in size to what it was before, yet it was still inferior to the original. ... Turning around, he was worried about the Dragon's reaction. ... It had apparently woken up, but for now, he just curiously looked over the tree.'The Dragon, I woke up the Dragon! ... Do I have to deal with that as well now?'After its curiosity was sated, it laid back down and started snoring once more.'Is that all that thing does?' Quinn thought. ... Thankfully the tree had stopped growing and the Dragon was no longer interested in it.[Inspect][Complete Rosesus tree][Linking with Amulet is now complete, amulet may be removed]Seeing the last message, Quinn felt relieved. ... Jumping up, he reached halfway to the tree, and grabbed onto it with one hand, before pulling out the amulet with the other, and jumping back down to the ground. ... With the Demon tier Amulet back in his possession, he noticed that it was radiating with even more energy than before and a system notification on the screen had popped up.[The Demon tier amulet has successfully been linked with the Rosesus tree][The Rosesus tree has become a permanent Marked]'Permanent Marked? ... Does it mean it's different from the Marked Dalki?'Straight away, Quinn activated the powers of the amulet and he could feel it, just like with the Dalki Quinn could take full control of the tree in front of him. ... In doing so, he was witnessing a view he had never seen before. ... The tree itself had roots that had been implanted not just in the ground beneath them, but the roots spread through the entire island. ... Using the power of the amulet Quinn could feel what the tree could do, he could control these roots so they would sprout up on the island. ... Controlling those roots, Quinn made one of them sprout somewhere in the jungle. ... He had chosen a thin one which sprouted from the ground in what appeared to be a Basic tier beast's burrow. ... Slowly creeping up to the bunny like creature, the root quickly wrapped around the beast. ... This was a completely different feeling from controlling the Dalki, as they had at least been humanoid, yet for some reason it felt easier to Quinn. ... However, controlling several at the same time proved to be a completely different story. ... The vision of the tree itself was as wide as its roots would go, but to focus on small details was a headache, as he had to try and ignore the rest of his vision which wasn't something easy to do. ... With the roots wrapped around the bunny, Quinn was about to let the beast go, until he could feel something else, that it wasn't the only thing the tree could do.'No this feels the same... ... it feels just like when I mark the Dalki with the Amulet!'Putting it to the test, Quinn attempted to mark it, and a surge of energy went though the bunny. ... A few seconds later the same marking appeared on the rabbit's underbelly. ... Through the tree, Quinn could control the Marked just how he would when he was using the amulet. ... In a way it was like having a second amulet, only better, for there was no need to store energy, it was using the energy of the tree itself. ... After a few more tests with the tree Quinn realised something else. ... The tree could do essentially everything that the Demon tier beast had been able to. ... Mark beasts, send energy from them and take energy away. ... The beasts wouldn't die either when energy was taken away. ... Still, he had quickly noticed that with every marked beast, the energy of the tree would lessen a little. ... The way this worked, it would have never been able to take over the Dragon, not that Quinn would ever dare to do so, afraid of its retaliation. ... Eventually, Quinn returned to himself, having discovered that the tree worked pretty much the same way as all his other Marked. ... The only downside he had found was that he couldn't use the amulet to directly control those that the tree had Marked. ... However, he could still give the bunny basic instructions like he did with the Dalki. ... For now, he just gave the tree the command to try and take over as many strong beats as it could on Blade Island.'Whoever comes here, will now be in for a huge surprise.' Quinn grinned, as he imagined the invaders having to face an army of wild beasts!******My Werewolf System has finally arrived on the Webnovel! ...

      "Underneath the Blade castle, both Vorden and Raten were sitting inside one of the cells. ... At the moment, the two Blade siblings were busy consuming crystals, one by one, impatiently waiting for the energy to be consumed by their bodies that would hopefully allow them to evolve to the next tier. ... Both of them were sitting on the ground, and had a small mountain of crystals next to them. ... According to Muddy and Tails, the easiest way for their bodies to absorb the energy inside those crystals was just to eat them. ... However, the downside was the drowsy feeling they would experience as their body was using that energy to grow. ... This was why they had decided to do it underground, away from any distraction of beasts or others and even if someone did come down, they would have to go through the cell doors first. ... To do that, they would have to pass Borden, who acted as a bodyguard for the two of them. ... Since there was no sign of anybody, Borden had just watched the show of Vorden and Raten seemingly competing in an eating contest. ... After consuming a crystal, both had their eyes closed, making it seem as if they had gone to sleep after overeating. ... Technically, evolution wasn't the only way for the two of them to get stronger in their current form. ... Although beasts were unable to activate most beast gear because of their body, there were some special crystals that could be made into beast gear for beasts. ... Unfortunately, they were so rare that the group hadn't come across any so far. ... Still, around Tail's waist there was a pouch that would allow Vorden to carry a few things around. ... The only thing currently inside was the green injection for little Borden to use his full strength whenever it was needed. ... It was almost impossible for Borden to carry them himself so he did need to rely on others for that part. ... Still, he was happy that he could help out. ... Walking up to Vorden's pile of crystals, Borden grabbed onto one of the crystals.'Dalki are half beast, right? ... So if I eat this thing will it help me grow stronger as well?' Borden wondered. ... He quickly disregarded this thought, despite how much he wanted to take the bite of the crystal for two reasons. ... The first was that it was his job to protect the other two. ... If the crystal worked on him in a similar fashion like it did for the two before him, then he would enter a weak state like them, so now wasn't the time to be testing things. ... The second reason was just common sense. ... If crystals really helped the Dalki race evolve, then they should have already been consuming them by now, Borden was sure they would have done the test for it.'I better just give this crystal back to them.' Borden thought, as he went to put the crystal in Vorden's hand so he didn't have to grab another one from the pile. ... It was at that moment, that he could see something coming from above the cave slowly moving. ... Most wouldn't have noticed, but Borden did.'What is that?' Borden thought, and immediately started to go for Vorden's pouch, carefully grabbing the injection. ... \"What's going on? ... \" Vorden asked in a sleepy tone. ... Injecting himself, the green energy was rising inside of him and his body started to grow until he was as big as his sleepy brothers. ... Reaching his full size, Borden quickly threw out both of his hands, and grabbed onto the objects that were moving.'What are these? ... Hang on, are these... ... tree roots?' Borden was confused. ... Surprisingly, the roots were not only durable but also very strong. ... Borden had only just finished his transformation, yet they were easily able to lift him up, swinging him to the ground right into a pile of crystals. ... This caused both Raten, and Vorden to come to their senses, and they both stood up. ... \"You little twerp, I thought you were meant to stop anyone from coming inside! ... \" Raten shouted in anger. ... \"They're coming from above! ... \" Borden shouted, as the two looked up, they could see several roots hovering in the air, yet Borden noticed that they seemed to be ignoring him, instead they seemed focused solely on the direction of his siblings. ... Quikly, Borden jumped up, and grabbed on to two of the roots again, hanging like a monkey on the vines. ... Using his strength, he tried his best to pull on the roots as hard as possible but no matter how hard he was pulling it didn't seem like it was breaking.'What the hell kind of tree is this?!'Meanwhile, Layla had just handed over the black sword to Quinn once again, who stood a few steps away from the tablet. ... Before he could reach the tablet, he suddenly felt the amulet around his neck connecting again.'I can feel the tree... ... is it struggling with something?' Quinn wondered. ... Curious what could have happened, Quinn decided to take Full Control over the tree again. ... Since the tree was busy in more than just one place, it took the Vampire Lord a while to find the reason for his amulet reaction.'Crap, stop, stop!!!' Quinn thought to himself. ... The underground roots retreated, as he made them go elsewhere. ... Exiting his Full Control, he went back to Partial Control and made sure to convey that the two of them were their allies, forbidding the tree for marking them.'Well, that was definitely a big mistake on my part.' Quinn blamed himself as he put on a guilty face. ... It was his own fault for giving the Rosesus tree the simple command of trying to take over as many strong beasts on the island as it could. ... With the Dragon next to it, he had kept in mind to exclude it from that list, but he had forgotten about Vorden and Raten.'Look, I didn't do it on purpose. ... It's just because I never saw those two as beasts in the first place, I just always thought of them as people like the rest of us.' Quinn thought, speaking to Vincent who he imagined was judging him at this point. ... Just to be on the safe side, he also designated Layla and the others as allies to prevent something like that happening in the future. ... Putting this short episode to the back of his mind, Quinn walked the last steps forwards, until he stood directly in front of the table, the black sword in his hand. ... Layla wasn't too far behind him, curious to see what would happen. ... Unafraid of the tablet, Quinn pressed his hand against it. ... \"Hey... ... hey are you there? ... You can still hear me, right? ... Last time you just stopped speaking to me, but I know something is up with this sword. ... It seems to be reacting to the tablet, or probably you and I know that it's also somehow connected to my Quest... ... \" Quinn continued to mumble, in the hopes of receiving an answer. ... The tablet started to light up brightly once again, just as it had done in the past when Quinn had touched it before. ... Finally the voice inside said something. ... \"Yes, I can hear you. ... It appears that you have brought something that is quite troublesome with you. ... \" The voice didn't seem too pleased about the sword in Quinn's hand. ... As for Quinn, he wasn't in a position to overly care about yet another disembodied voice, he just wanted to complete the Quest, if only to learn more about his Talen family line. ... \"A quest, you say? ... Now, that's something I haven't heard in a long time. ... What type of quest are you on? ... Who has told you to bring this sword to me? ... I mean, with the way I am now I can't exactly do anything about it. ... ... ... was it that damned woman again? ... \" The voice on the tablet started to ramble. ... When learning that all of the abilities came from the tablet, and it was from this great being that lived in the tablet, Quinn thought that perhaps he was some type of god, but the more he listened to him the more it sounded like a normal person like everyone else. ... He also thought there was a simple misunderstanding. ... Quinn was referring to the Quest his system had given him, but it sounded like the one in the tablet thought someone had sent him on a quest. ... \"Look, I really don't know how long I can speak to you for. ... Last time we were cut off before I could even ask you the questions that only you might be able to answer, so we need to hurry this up. ... I can tell this sword isn't a beast weapon, so just what is it? ... What does it have to do with my Talen family? ... \"There was silence from the tablet for a while. ... Quinn was starting to worry that the connection had disappeared once more. ... \"Can you hear me? ... I need to know more about the sword, or at least about my family. ... Please, you might really be the only one to help me with that. ... \" Quinn pleaded, since that person had been the only lead he had in that direction. ... \"Yes... ... I know about the Talen family... ... and I know about the sword as well... ... I suppose it's better if I start from the beginning. ... My original name was Sen. ... \"Quinn was happy that the voice agreed to his request, but he didn't have time for any long winded life stories, not when he was worried that any second now the connection would break off just like it had done the last time. ... To be frank, Quinn could care less about the name of the one inside the tablet? ... He just needed to get answers to his questions, so why start from the beginning. ... \"I say my original name, because my story is a bit special. ... To be more precise I was reincarnated into a human and I bore the name given to me by my parents. ... A name that reminded them of a ray of sunshine... ... \"'Come on already!' Quinn was about to shout in anger. ... \"They gave me the name of Ray Talen. ... \"*******My Werewolf System has finally arrived on the Webnovel! ...

      "Layla was left standing there not really knowing what to do as strange things were happening around Quinn. ... One moment she saw the amulet light up around his neck and the next second the tree started to grow in size, without him explaining anything to her. ... However, judging by his reaction it was only because Quinn was just as surprised by the consequences of his actions as she was. ... The next moment, Quinn seemed to be concentrating extremely hard. ... \"Don't worry about Quinn. ... He's just playing with the tree for a little bit and should probably be back soon. ... \" Vincent turned around, informind Layla: It had become a natural thing for the two of them to switch whenever Quinn would use his Full Control.'There he is again, the same person as last time. ... I can tell that's not Quinn, but then just who is it? ... I doubt Shiro planted someone else inside Quinn's mind, so does that mean there has always been someone else inside his body?' That thought saddened Layla, not because it would mean that Quinn was in a situation similar to that of Vorden, Raten and Sil, but the fact that he had decided to keep it a secret even from her. ... Even though she couldn't have helped him in any way with it, it would have been nice if he could have confided in her. ... Layla was about to ask that mysterious person who he was, but then the real Quinn appeared in front of her asking to borrow the sword once again. ... Not having any reason to refuse him, she handed it over and without explaining anything he started to walk towards the tablet.'Quinn, why do so many strange things happen around you? ... There're many people who believe the world revolves around them, that only their life is important, but when I watch youâ¦ it's as if I realise how unimportant my own life is in comparison. ... At the moment, the whole world really does seem to be revolving around you.' Layla thought, as she rubbed her elbow up and down with her hand. ... A few moments later, the watch around her wrist started to vibrate, indicating that there was an incoming call. ... \"Hey Layla, thank God, you answered. ... \" Sam said from the other side. ... It was clear he was worried about something, making Layla think that the attack might have started, which would probably be the worst timing with Quinn out of it once more. ... \"Are the two of you okay, have you been attacked as well? ... \" Sam asked. ... \"Huh? ... No, we're both fine, we're just by the tablet at the moment. ... What's going on, who was attacked and by whom? ... \"\"It's the Blades. ... They came back to report that while they had been underground they had been attacked by some roots. ... I tried to get in contact with the others, but fortunately they seem to be the only ones who have been attacked so far. ... \"When hearing the words roots, straight away Layla's mind went to the giant tree in the middle. ... The timing of the attack, and when Quinn was messing around with the tree seemed to be quite similar. ... \"Are they okay now, they're not being attacked anymore, are they? ... \" Layla asked. ... \"No, but they have decided to move away from the underground cells and into the castle. ... So their session has been delayed a little. ... \" Sam explained. ... \"I think it might have something to do with Quinn.' Layal saad thinking back to the time before the tablet. ... \"There should be no need to panic, but I'll ask him once he's done. ... \" Layla said, hanging up the call there. ... Layla's answer had only added to his confusion. ... 'When he's done? ... When he's done with what exactly?'âââListening to the voice in the tablet speak, Quinn was sure of it. ... It had just claimed that its name used to be Ray Talen, the same family name that Quinn currently had himself. ... Now, the Quest was starting to make sense, but the only thing was, nothing else was making sense to him. ... \"Ray Talenâ¦ so that means we're related, right? ... But how? ... I thought you were some sort of God that gave all the world their abilities? ... How is that possible? ... Is my father a God? ... Does that make me a god as well? ... But I'm a vampire! ... \" Quinn's reaction to this sudden information was to blurt out a bunch of questions. ... In all honesty, he had been through some pretty crazy things before as he learned about his vampire side of his family, learned about Eno's past, learned about Arthur and Vincent, but this information was one thing that made no sense in his head at all. ... In the first place, his family carried the Talen name which had come from his father. ... Not the Eno family name, which most likely meant that Quinn's vampire side had come from his mother, but he had no clue that his non-vampire side would also be so special. ... \"Calm down, boy. ... Has it been so long that you've forgotten what I said to you last time? ... \" Ray questioned him. ... \"I was a being that was even more powerful than the Gods. ... Still, the fact remains, that before I reached that point, I did live my life as a human. ... \" \"My parents, although I carried their blood, my own existence and powers continued inside of me, my body changed and I eventually passed that on. ... It must have eventually reached you. ... When I asked your name last time, I realised that this had to be the most likely reason as for why the two of us are able to talk. ... \" \"Please take note that we are talking about a few 1000 years between my generation and yours, so don't ask me if I know your mother or father, I can already predict your next question. ... \"If Quinn and Ray really were related in some way, then it would make sense why his family also had no clue about this. ... His mother or their mothers for so much time had passed. ... Still there was one thing that was on Quinn's mind. ... If this person wasn't a god, then what was he? ... \"Whatâ¦ exactly were you? ... It's already hard for me to even imagine how great a God would be, but then what is greater than that? ... \" Quinn asked. ... \"I was once feared all over the land. ... Humans would tell their children about me, the Unstoppable Great Red Dragon Sen! ... Ga,ga,ga! ... \" Ray started to let out a weird laugh, one that sounded as if it belonged to a beast more so than a human.'What the hell is going on, Vincent?' Quinn asked, hoping that he wasn't just going crazy.'Unfortunately, I'm as lost as you on this one. ... Perhaps you should ask Ray for a bit of context.' Vincent suggested. ... \"So, you were something above a Demon tier beast? ... Should I picture you like a red version of the Dragon guarding this tablet then?' Quinn asked. ... \"Please, do you really think I was that weak? ... \" Ray replied in disdain. ... \"Not to belittle my scaly friend on the outside, but do you really think someone like that could grant nearly all the abilities that exist today? ... \" \"Alas, as powerful as I was, I had been tricked. ... I was taught a harsh lesson, you see. ... Someone had wished for me to help the humans but as Sen I had remained stubborn, so they made me live life as a human and through that I learned to care for them. ... Ultimately, I ended up doing just what was wanted of me, and to my shock I did so out of my own volition. ... \"\"I am happy to hear that even so many years later one of my descendants is also helping out the human race. ... I fought hard for this planet, and while I know how heavy that burden is, I'm happy that with you humanity should be in good hands. ... \"For all his newfound enthusiasm, a lot of Ray's words went right through Quinn who he was busy trying to wrap his head around what he really was. ... If he had Dragon blood and Vampire blood inside of himâ¦ did he even have any human blood running through his veins? ... However, as crazy as everything sounded, Quinn felt like the tablet had no reason to lie. ... Dragons, just like vampires were things that should belong in fairy tales, yet they had to have come from somewhere. ... If the existence of vampires were real, then why couldn't he believe in real dragons as well. ... Not just some Demon tier beast that stood behind him. ... He just never thought that he would be related to them. ... \"So about this sword... ... it definitely is not a beast weapon, but did it belong to you? ... \" Quinn asked, trying to change the topic to something easier to understand. ... \"No. ... \" Ray answered and this time his voice became more concerned and less playful. ... \"That sword belonged to a dear friend of mine. ... It helped us on our journey, and it looks like it found a way to help you out on yours as well. ... However, that sword doesn't have anything to do with our family line. ... \" \"Truth be told, I do not know much about it, but I do know that there is someone who might. ... There is a being that I knew back in the past during my time. ... She should still be prancing around even today. ... You might have even met her since she loves to meddle in things. ... \"\"During my time she went by Bliss. ... Seek her outâ¦ or wait until she seeks you out. ... Since you have my blood it should happen sooner or later. ... I'm sure she will tell you more about the sword. ... \"[New quest received][Meet with the Divine being]'Divine beingâ¦is this the Bliss person he was talking about?'The light on the tablet started to fade again, and Quinn could tell that the time to speak was running out. ... \"It looks like our time is coming to an end. ... You have my blood running through your veins, and if you really are a Talen, then the Dalki won't even be worth your time. ... Just continue to grow, get stronger and evolve. ... As one of my blood there will be no cap for you. ... The Talen family is able to go even beyond anyone's expectations, trust me on that. ... \"Hearing these words, Quinn thought of another quest he had received. ... [Become something beyond a Vampire lord]For some reason, after his little talk with Ray, Quinn was feeling more confident than ever. ... The tiredness he felt before, the defeats he had suffered, he realised that a small part of him had started to give up hope. ... It had started to doubt if we could manage to get strong enough to stop them, but now there was a new ray of hope.\n",

      "🔊 [Chapter 580] Preparing: Chapter 1278: Planned or not? ... The light from the tablet started to dye down, and Layla could finally see Quinn removing his hand from the tablet. ... She expected Quinn to look half defeated as so far he had been. ... Especially based on the faces she had seen him pull while his hand was on the tablet, but instead, she saw a smile on his face.'Did he find the answer he was looking for?' Layla wondered. ... Seeing Quinn's smile gave a warm feeling in Layla's heart as well.'My emotions, they are all over the place. ... Is it because of the subclass?' Her vampire subclass caused her emotions to be more heightened than usual. ... She had experienced this before, sadness, anger, and happiness. ... All of these emotions would be multiplied compared to before she was turned. ... But it was also what allowed her to evolve into her other forms. ... The stronger the emotion, the more strength she had. ... On top of this, she also noticed that the sword she had given to Quinn was no longer rattling. ... When she was next to the tablet, Layla had attempted to touch it herself. ... While holding the sword, there was no such effect for her.'You are a special one, aren't you?' Layla thought, and before she knew it, Quinn was directly in front of her, handing the sword back over. ... \"I didn't really find out much about the sword\", Quinn said. ... \"Just that it used to belong to someone else a long time ago. ... It looks like you can keep on using it with no worries. ... Speaking of, have you ever heard of anyone named Bliss? ... \" Quinn asked. ... He knew it was a long shot, but Layla and the others did live a life before him, and there was a time when she was at Pure for a good while. ... Perhaps she had met this person at some point, but soon seeing her shake her head, Quinn realised that this wasn't going to be an easy task. ... \"Maybe the Divine being? ... \" Quinn asked again, referring to the name the system had given her rather than the one Ray had. ... Still, Layla shook her head. ... Layla found it a bit strange that Quinn was looking for someone after touching the tablet, and she wanted to ask why. ... Still, he seemed to be in deep thought. ... He was thinking about how to complete the next part of the quest. ... While also a little annoyed that he hadn't received anything for finding out about his Talen family bloodline.'Is it because I received another quest straight after? ... Maybe this is like a chain, and I won't get the real reward until I complete the whole thing.' Quinn wondered. ... More importantly, he needed to figure out how to find this person. ... Although Ray said there was a chance she would come to him, why hadn't she done so far? ... Everyone knew who he was. ... The Blade's could get to him, so he was sure if someone was looking for him, they would have been able to find him. ... \"You know, if you're looking for someone, maybe she should ask Logan,\" Layla suggested. ... \"He has access to military files and more information than we can imagine. ... I would guess he could find whoever you are looking for, but with just a first name like Bliss, I don't know how much it would help. ... \"It was a good suggestion to make, and Quinn certainly would ask Logan, but he had a feeling it wouldn't work either.'I have never heard of this Bliss character either.' Vincent said. ... 'But you have to remember. ... The person in the tablet said he had lived 1000 years ago. ... If this is a friend of his, or someone that knew him, then maybe many don't know who this person is.'However, there are those that have also lived for 1000 of years that might know the answer, and one of them is on this very island.''Please.' Quinn almost begged Vincent, hoping that he wasn't suggesting what he was suggesting. ... After his mood had just picked up again, was he really telling him to see if Eno knew who Bliss or the Divine being was?'Alright... ... I guess I can't help it, and I need to talk to him at some point anyway.' Quinn sighed. ... 'Even if our views or morals are different, our goals are the same for now.'\"Layla, I just wanted to say thanks for being by my side this whole time. ... Why don't you meet up with Sam, catch up on whatever plans he has at the moment, and then come back to me? ... There's something else I need to do. ... \" Quinn said. ... Not wanting to waste any more time, Quinn ran off, heading towards the castle's direction. ... Judging by the fact that Quinn was heading that way and not speaking to Sam himself, Layla could tell who he was going to talk to. ... 'I just hope nothing happens between the two of them.' Layla thought, making her way towards the castle herself. ... It didn't take long with Quinn's speed to find Eno, and it wasn't hard to find him since he had remained at the same place Quinn had last seen him, on top of the castle. ... His back was facing away from Quinn while Brock was looking towards him. ... He knew that Eno knew Quinn was there, yet still didn't turn around, and seeing the red blood armour, Quinn had many thoughts running through his head.'The blood armour, Eno had it all this time, and the other vampires didn't even know about it. ... I guess this is someone who even tricked Arthur, someone who he allowed to call him friends even knowing what he did.'I also can't help but think that this isn't the only thing that Eno is hiding.' Quinn thought. ... What stood out to Quinn as well was the crown-like figure on his head. ... He hadn't seen that before, not even on Arthurs set, and he was sure it wasn't just for show. ... \"I hope you haven't come back here to give me a lecture because if so, you are better off continuing what you were doing before\", Eno replied. ... From the castle, Eno had a clear view of what Quinn was doing, and perhaps he had even figured out what was happening, but Quinn knew that he couldn't hear the conversation he had just had. ... Otherwise he would understand why he was here. ... \"I wanted to ask you something, something about-'Just as Quinn was about to ask his question, he saw Brock turn around and look the other way. ... Quinn also stopped mid-speech because he could hear it as well. ... He quickly ran to the edge of the castle wall and looked out far in the distance, where the vast blue sea could be seen. ... Large giant circles were opening all over the place. ... They looked similar to the portals that everyone used, but there was no device to activate them. ... Seemingly they had just opened up out of thin air over the ocean floating there. ... Not just one but around twenty or so. ... The real worry was that they weren't small portals for humans either, and before they knew it. ... Several spaceships, around ten from each portal, had come through the teleporters. ... There were so many ships that Quinn couldn't keep count of them, and they were now all moving towards the Blade island. ... What stood out about them was they didn't look like Dalki ships. ... \"How manyâ¦.. ... how many have they sent to this island? ... \" Quinn said. ... \"I had a feeling he would go all out,\" Eno said, looking out still unmoving, but his fist was tense. ... \"Jim, why do this much?'

The roar was so loud that Quinn had covered his ears, and when the sound had calmed, he looked over at the beast.'No.. ... no, no no!' Quinn thought. ...

      "Chapter Text Preview:  Chapter 1278: Planned or not? ... The light from the tablet started to dye down, and Layla could finally see Quinn removing his hand from the tablet. ... She expected Quinn to look half defeated as so far he had been. ... Especially based on the faces she had seen him pull while his hand was on the tablet, but instead, she saw a smile on his face.'Did he find the answer he was looking for?' Layla wondered. ... Seeing Quinn's smile gave a warm feeling in Layla's heart as well.'My emotions, they are all over the place. ... Is it because of the subclass?' Her vampire subclass caused her emotions to be more heightened than usual. ... She had experienced this before, sadness, anger, and happiness. ... All of these emotions would be multiplied compared to before she was turned. ... But it was also what allowed her to evolve into her other forms. ... The stronger the emotion, the more strength she had. ... On top of this, she also noticed that the sword she had given to Quinn was no longer rattling. ... When she was next to the tablet, Layla had attempted to touch it herself. ... While holding the sword, there was no such effect for her.'You are a special one, aren't you?' Layla thought, and before she knew it, Quinn was directly in front of her, handing the sword back over. ... \"I didn't really find out much about the sword\", Quinn said. ... \"Just that it used to belong to someone else a long time ago. ... It looks like you can keep on using it with no worries. ... Speaking of, have you ever heard of anyone named Bliss? ... \" Quinn asked. ... He knew it was a long shot, but Layla and the others did live a life before him, and there was a time when she was at Pure for a good while. ... Perhaps she had met this person at some point, but soon seeing her shake her head, Quinn realised that this wasn't going to be an easy task. ... \"Maybe the Divine being? ... \" Quinn asked again, referring to the name the system had given her rather than the one Ray had. ... Still, Layla shook her head. ... Layla found it a bit strange that Quinn was looking for someone after touching the tablet, and she wanted to ask why. ... Still, he seemed to be in deep thought. ... He was thinking about how to complete the next part of the quest. ... While also a little annoyed that he hadn't received anything for finding out about his Talen family bloodline.'Is it because I received another quest straight after? ... Maybe this is like a chain, and I won't get the real reward until I complete the whole thing.' Quinn wondered. ... More importantly, he needed to figure out how to find this person. ... Although Ray said there was a chance she would come to him, why hadn't she done so far? ... Everyone knew who he was. ... The Blade's could get to him, so he was sure if someone was looking for him, they would have been able to find him. ... \"You know, if you're looking for someone, maybe she should ask Logan,\" Layla suggested. ... \"He has access to military files and more information than we can imagine. ... I would guess he could find whoever you are looking for, but with just a first name like Bliss, I don't know how much it would help. ... \"It was a good suggestion to make, and Quinn certainly would ask Logan, but he had a feeling it wouldn't work either.'I have never heard of this Bliss character either.' Vincent said. ... 'But you have to remember. ... The person in the tablet said he had lived 1000 years ago. ... If this is a friend of his, or someone that knew him, then maybe many don't know who this person is.'However, there are those that have also lived for 1000 of years that might know the answer, and one of them is on this very island.''Please.' Quinn almost begged Vincent, hoping that he wasn't suggesting what he was suggesting. ... After his mood had just picked up again, was he really telling him to see if Eno knew who Bliss or the Divine being was?'Alright... ... I guess I can't help it, and I need to talk to him at some point anyway.' Quinn sighed. ... 'Even if our views or morals are different, our goals are the same for now.'\"Layla, I just wanted to say thanks for being by my side this whole time. ... Why don't you meet up with Sam, catch up on whatever plans he has at the moment, and then come back to me? ... There's something else I need to do. ... \" Quinn said. ... Not wanting to waste any more time, Quinn ran off, heading towards the castle's direction. ... Judging by the fact that Quinn was heading that way and not speaking to Sam himself, Layla could tell who he was going to talk to. ... 'I just hope nothing happens between the two of them.' Layla thought, making her way towards the castle herself. ... It didn't take long with Quinn's speed to find Eno, and it wasn't hard to find him since he had remained at the same place Quinn had last seen him, on top of the castle. ...

      "In the grand universe where the beast planets were located, the Cursed ship was currently making its way towards the Cursed faction planets. ... They had been informed that the Earthborn group as well as the Graylash group were already under attack, so they were worried that the Cursed faction would be next. ... Unlike in the past, when the Dalki had owned one half of the beast planets circulating around the solar system's sun, while humanity in the other, the balance had shifted to the point that the latter were down to a total of nine planets. ... It was hard to decide where it was exactly safe for the humans to travel. ... In one half of the solar system, the planets that the humans used to own were split into the three sections belonging to the three groups. ... The Earthborn planets were situated directly in the centre between the planets of the other two factions. ... The Cursed ship had left from Planet Caladi, which was located in the Earthborn section and was now heading over to the Cursed faction section, but would have to go past planets that had already been taken over. ... They strayed widely from the other planets and wanted to make it so they were a reasonable distance both from the Cursed faction planets and the Earthborn planets. ... However, not too long after setting off on their journey, the Cursed ship had been put to a halt, as it had received some devastating news. ... \"Miss Megan, we have terrible news! ... \" One of the Cursed members shouted from inside the teleportation room. ... \"The teleporter you told us to keep watch out for, it has gone offline! ... It's not activating at all. ... We have performed all the tests to check if it's something on our endâ¦ but the result was that whatever happened to the teleporter had to have occured on the other end! ... \"\"Worst case scenario, judging by how abruptly the signal has cut off without any prior warning, the most likely scenario is that it was destroyed! ... \"Just as the Cursed faction member had reported, the teleporter had gone offline. ... Just seconds ago, it had been glowing brightly as the portal had been designated the highest priority. ... Everyone had been instructed to do everything in their power to keep it active, so they could use it as soon as the fighting would start. ... Hearing this news, Megan was biting down hard on her nails inside the command centre. ... \"What do I do? ... What can we do? ... Does it mean those guys are in trouble? ... \"\"I'm sure Sam will give us an update on their situation any second now. ... Let's wait for his response before we decide on what to do next. ... \" Chucky tried to calm Megan down, while Shiro nodded in approval. ... The two of them got on with each other, since they had seen each other around the school, and they were also currently the ones helping out Megan take care of the Cursed ship while the others were away. ... \"Even if their teleporter is broken, aren't there other ways to reach them? ... Like maybe we could ask to use one from the Earthborn group? ... They should have one that leads to Earth, and then we can fly to Blade Island from there? ... \" Shiro suggested. ... \"No, we can't. ... \" Megan shook her head. ... \"Supreme Commander Sach has put out an executive order that no one is to use that one. ... Even though Logan had created the jammers, he deems it too risky. ... Right now, no one is allowed to have active teleporters leading to Earth. ... The one on Blade Island was meant to be the sole exception to that rule. ... \"\"The only way to head back to Earth is through the space stationâ¦ which is offline. ... \"Even though they might be able to reason with Supreme Commander Sach under normal circumstances, right now he was busy with his own set of troubles. ... This was also the reason why Megan hadn't called Sam straight back, after all signs pointed to the teleporter being destroyed. ... She couldn't risk distracting any of them, if they were in the middle of fighting. ... Still, Megan did send out a message and if all things were still okay then Sam should hopefully be giving her a reply soon. ... \"What about Sergeant Nathan? ... \" Chucky asked. ... \"He used to be a Head General, right? ... Don't you think he could perhaps still pull some strings for us and get that Earth station working again? ... Besides, depending on how large the forces are attacking Blade island, we could use Nathan's and his group's help anyway. ... \"It was a good suggestion, so Megan got ready to call Nathan, but one thought passed through her head. ... What about the Cursed faction planets? ... For now they had working teleporters on their planets, but who is to say the Dalki didn't find a way to outright destroy those teleporters? ... Wasn't there a good chance that whatever happened on Blade Island would happen here again? ... Would it really be alright to have the Cursed ship head to Earth? ... It would be a long time before they could arriveâ¦\"The decision is up to you. ... Sam trusted you, so we will go with whatever you say. ... \" Shiro tried to encourage her and Chucky also agreed with that. ... After the almighty roar from the Demon tier beast, everyone was already running towards the top of the castle. ... It was the perfect vantage point to allow them to see where exactly the enemy was coming from and how many of them there were. ... To everyone's surprise, their numbers far surpassed even their wildest speculations. ... \"I thought that we might have had some time to prepare more. ... \" Sam sighed, looking out into the distance. ... The ships were far away and moving slowly towards them, but it just meant they would soon face an organised and coordinated attack. ... Everyone had believed that things would go down just like it had happened on the other planets when the Dalki had invaded, namely that a mothership of some kind would have appeared and sent down Dalki. ... However there was one person who was not with the group. ... Mona stood far out on the sandy beach of the island, looking into the sea. ... \"Thanks for the little warning. ... \" Mona grinned, as she lifted up her pointy hat a little to be able to have a better look. ... Finally the ships were starting to make their way towards the island. ... \"These guys really seem to think that taking over Blade Island will be that easy. ... \" She smiled, soon throwing off her hat to the side revealing her long braided dark purple hair that almost looked black, apart from when it moved in the sunlight. ... Running out on the sand, Mona looked fearless and not for a second did she slow down her pace. ... Eventually, she leapt into the air, jumping several feet, a height no regular human would be able to reach without top tier beast armour. ... After she passed the shore line, there was only the sea below her and it looked like she would crash into it at any second, but then a dark shadow from underneath appeared. ... Moments before her toes could touch the water Mona landed on a solid white surface. ... In the giant sea of water, a small white piece of land had suddenly appeared, and it slowly started to rise higher and higher, and that's when those from the castle could see what it was as well. ... \"That looks awfully similar to the giant creature that attacked us when we first arrived hereâ¦ only a little different? ... \" Logan did not remember the beast having white skin, and at the same time its eyes were almost glowing blue. ... Not only that, but now that it had revealed itself its overall size seemed to have increased a little as well. ... Four ships that were headed out front tried to quickly avoid the giant octopus and attempted to go around the side of it. ... Soon though, they could see large tentacles in its view. ... Two of them were slammed out of the air, and their ships sank into the sea. ... One of the other spaceships had managed to fly out further to the left of the beast, allowing it to notice the creature before the others. ... Being further back it had managed to avoid the attack, but soon a jet of water, that spiralled out and shot out like a laser hit the ship blowing it up on the spot. ... The final fourth ship seeing this was thankful that the beast had chosen not to use its attack on itself, and was hoping to land upon the planet soon. ... However, that's when he noticed at the last second, running on one of the tentacles, was a female looking human. ... When Mona got to the end of the beasts' tentacle, it soon grabbed her, and threw her towards the fourth ship. ... Using her great strength, she grabbed on to the back, and lifted both her hands. ... Activating the power of all her beast gear she slammed down causing an explosion by the engine, and quickly jumped back off, allowing the octopus beast to catch her again and place her on the head. ... \"Unfortunately for you, I owe that Cursed boy, and his grandfather a favour. ... \" Mona spoke, seemingly to herself. ... \"As the only one of the former Big Four present, I will make sure that you pay a heavy price if you intend to reach that island. ... \"It was at that moment, Quinn used his Inspect skill, noticing the octopus had clearly demonstrated a speed, strength, size and skills surpassing its former self, yet it looked too similar to the last one to be a different beast.[Inspect][Ala Kraken - Demon tier beast]\"Did you really think you were the only ones that knew how to evolve beasts? ... \" Quinn didn't need to turn around to be able to imagine that smug smile that was sure to be on Eno's face.*******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Quinn couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. ... Another Demon tier beast had appeared on the island or more accurately in the sea. ... What's more, it seemed to be a beast he was all too familiar with. ... When first coming to the island, he had run into it and it had ended up demolishing Logan's precious submarine. ... On their second visit, Quinn had seen Mona tame the beast, a feat so amazing that she might be the only one able to achieve such a thing, with the exception of Sil perhaps, but he clearly remembered that the Kraken had not been a Demon tier beast at the time. ... The confusing part was that Mona had once claimed that she didn't think it possible for her to be able to control a Demon tier beast, due to the way her ability worked. ... She only had enough MC cells to control a Demi-god tier beast, with perhaps a few lower tier ones on top of that. ... After learning that beasts like Muddy and Tails could evolve, it wasn't out of the realm of possibility that the Kraken beast could evolve as well, however Quinn would have thought that in that case it should have broken free from Mona's control. ... Fortunately, the one beside him decided to solve that mystery for him. ... \"Mona's role in this war had always been bigger than she could ever imagine. ... \" Eno proceeded to explain, while they all continued to watch her fight off the incoming spaceships. ... \"I took her in to make sure she would be able to fulfill her role, the only thing she really needed was some guidance. ... \"People often believe to know everything there is to know about their own ability, especially one passed down in a family, but those are usually the ones who lack creativity. ... When it comes to abilities, it never hurts to try and think outside the box. ... \"\"For example, once a beast has been put under control using the taming ability, a link will have already been established between the tamer and the beast. ... No matter how strong the beast gets or how weak she would grow, there is no getting out for the beast unless the controller either wills it soâ¦ or dies. ... \" \"In most instances, it's easier to capture a higher tier beast to grow stronger than to evolve one. ... On the other hand, how many could claim to be able to get a Demi-god tier beast under their control in the first place. ... Once captured it was worth the investment to make it evolve. ... \" Eno finished his explanations. ... The others hearing this, were amazed that they had an actual Demon tier beast fighting on their side. ... Even faced with the large number of enemies in front of them, they now felt some confidence that perhaps they weren't as doomed as they had come to believe. ... Losing the teleporter had been a bitter pill to swallow, not only because it had cut off their path of retreat, but also because they could no longer expect any backup from Sil, one of their strongest members. ... They all knew how much of a blow this was to the team, so the realization that Eno had prepared something none of them had ever considered was very reassuring. ... Unfortunately, despite Mona doing her best to get rid of as many of those ships exiting those portals, there were just far too many for her and the Kraken to deal with on their own. ... It didn't take long for a number of them to make it past her. ... Seeing this, the others were preparing to use their abilities to knock the ships out of the sky, or block the incoming energy blasts that were able to be shot out from the ships. ... At the moment, the group could see two different types of ships they could make out, one larger but slower, the other faster and more mobile. ... The former seemed to be dropships similar to the ones the Graylash group had used when they had gone up against the Sunshield family, unless modified they should have around two dozen people inside. ... The latter were obviously ones meant to attack, fast and agile with one or two pilots inside. ... Although Mona had concentrated on taking them out, currently a group of them was heading straight for the castle, their energy blasters ready to fire. ... In total, six ships had managed to get past the Kraken, their blasters could be seen charging up, but before any of the Cursed faction could make their move, a gust of wind could be felt and the next second, a large shadow was cast over them all. ... \"Theâ¦. ... the Dragon! ... \" Layla called out. ... She had her bow ready but quickly put it down when she could only see its back. ... The small ships fired their energy blasts, but the Demon tier beast didn't even show any signs that it had noticed being hit. ... It seemed indifferent to the attacks and once it was close enough it opened its maw wide to reveal an orange light from behind its fangs. ... The next second a stream of fire came bursting out, engulfing two of the ships in flames. ... When the Dragon stopped its fire breath the small ships could no longer be seen. ... Normally, at least a few parts would have fallen to ground, yet it was as if it had just disappeared, not even leaving behind any ash. ... The Dragon didn't stop there, using its large tail in lightning fast manner it struck three other ships down, and with a flap of it's giant wing, one of the ships was thrown off balance before it crashed into it with its giant jaw. ... The six small spaceships were no match at all for the giant Demon tier beast. ... After getting rid of the little flying annoyances that had entered its flight space, the Dragon seemed to have calmed down, returning to its apparently favorite location. ... When it landed it shook the whole castle that the Cursed group were on. ... \"Well, it looks like as long as we have him on our side, we won't lose this fight! ... \" Fex exclaimed, in amazement. ... It was nice knowing that a beast they had once run from with their lives on the line was now on their side. ... As quickly as things had started to look up though, they also started to look down again. ... Having learned from the mistakes of their predecessors, most ships had made the smart decision to fly around the area of the Kraken's current location. ... At the same time, due to the Dragon's performance, instead of flying over the island and angering the beast, the dropships had decided to land on the outer edges, allowing the people on board to safely get out. ... However, the forces didn't stop there, as several underwater boats that had been hiding, also came onto shore. ... \"They were in the sea as well! ... \" Nate shouted, seeing as one of the ships opened, and several people were seen coming out from the ship. ... From a distance, the others couldn't tell if they were human or vampires, but Quinn could use his Inspect skill and he was quite surprised about the outcome, for there were a mixture of vampires and humans among the attackers. ... All of the men that had come out were wearing a black mask that covered their faces, with only slits over their eyes, so it was impossible for anyone but Quinn to tell at a glance. ... There seemed to be one human for every twenty or so vampires. ... 'How have they managed to gather this many forces? ... Wasn't Jim supposed to be a vampire who broke off on his own? ... Even if he somehow managed to take control over all the spies sent out by the vampires, would they really amount to this many?' Quinn thought. ... Something wasn't adding up, and he knew the one who would know the answer. ... In the first place, where were their own reinforcements? ... Sure, the teleporter had just been destroyed, but what about all the clones that Eno had spread around the place? ... \"Their forces are far larger than what we had estimated. ... We need to proceed with the plan instead of just looking at what is happening. ... \" Sam rallied the Cursed group, trying to knock everyone out of their daze. ... \"They are attacking from all over the island, and will slowly be coming forward. ... We need to stick to the plan and start it now! ... \"\"How are we meant to proceed with the plan when there's only us? ... \" Linda questioned him. ... \"We need to come up with another idea, otherwise their numbers will simply overwhelm us. ... There has to be thousands of them while we number less than twenty, and I'm sure they have some strong ones among them. ... \"Gritting his teeth, Sam had to admit that their plan wasn't looking too feasible right now. ... If only they could somehow coordinate their attacks with the Dragonâ¦ Unfortunately, if that would have been that easy, Eno wouldn't have had to work together with the Cursed faction, in hopes of Sil taking control over the Demon tier beast. ... Without him, not only was it impossible but also risky. ... What's more, if their enemies were attacking with this many people, they surely had to have some trump card that would allow them to deal with the Demon tier beastâ¦ So while it was in the centre of the island, they had to stop anyone from getting close. ... \"I might not have a way to overpower them, but I have something that should be able to slow them down. ... \" Quinn said. ... \"Do you think that will be enough for the rest of you to proceed with the plan as you originally intended? ... I'm sorry that I wasn't there when you were discussing the plan earlier, but I was doing something important. ... \" Quinn said, holding onto the amulets and closing his eyes, before he mumbled. ... \"I'll leave this side to you then. ... \"Taking Full Control, Quinn saw everything that the Roseus tree did, making it easy for him to lead the army of beasts where they were needed. ... As for the one controlling his body at the moment, it was none other than Vincent. ... Opening his eyes, 'Quinn' now gave off a different vibe. ... \"Tell me, what I need to do. ... \" Vincent requested. ... 'It's that other personâ¦ again.' Layla noticed, but she wasn't the only one to have noticed something.'Thisâ¦ 'person' isn't Quinn right nowâ¦ but why do I get a familiar feeling from him?' Eno wondered.\n",

      "Something that Quinn had never thought about was the changes that happened each time Vincent would be in control over his body. ... The fluctuations in one's voice, the energy that surrounded them, the rhythm of their heartbeat and more, all would be determined by the person who was in control of a body. ... The human mind was far more incredible than many might think, noticing those changes Eno could tell almost immediately that someone else had taken over Quinn's body. ... On top of that, the old vampire had also heard the words his 'grandson' had mumbled just before that. ... Finally, when Vincent spoke, Eno was convinced that he wasn't Quinn. ... \"Tell me, what I need to do? ... \" Vincent requested. ... Sam and the others had already grouped up, ready to head off into their positions. ... They had decided to split up into four different groups covering each side of where the enemy would come from. ... Linda, Wevil and Peter as one group, Sam, Nate and Layla as another, with Dennis and Fex as the third group. ... The fourth group would be the Blades, but judging by the fact they had yet to arrive at the top of the castle despite everything happening outside, they seemed to be busy.'If they're still not here, it should mean that Vorden and Raten are still not done with their evolution and Borden must be staying by their side to guard them.' Sam thought, trying to think of a way to make up for the loss of the Blades.'Wait, maybe Peter would be a good replacement, after all he has those two by his side.' But when Sam looked up, Peter was nowhere to be seen. ... \"Peter, where the hell is Peter? ... \" Sam questioned, and realised that he had never come up with the rest. ... Now he had to come up with another idea. ... Honestly he was worried that if they thinned out any of the three groups, especially with Peter gone, it would be too much for the groups to handle. ... \"I suggest, the three groups cover the East, West, and South sides. ... \" Sam spoke up. ... \"At the moment, Mona is doing a great job stopping those at the North side, so we should be able to leave it be for now. ... Hopefully she can hold off long enough for the Blades to reinforce her. ... \"If that wasn't the case, then Sam would have to try to act while on the ground, whichever group was doing best, they could shuffle one person to try and help. ... \"What about us? ... \" Vincent asked. ... \"What will the three of us be doing? ... \"\"Us three, need to make sure that thing is under control and we will be staying by its side at all times. ... \" Brock answered looking down at the Dragon. ... Vincent quickly understood. ... The enemy would have to send out their strongest members to deal with the Demon tier beast. ... Perhaps they would ignore the rest of the Cursed faction and head straight for the beast, which was why supposedly the three strongest members had been told to keep guard. ... \"I have a suggestion to make. ... I can help out with protecting the North side, the rest of you focus on covering your sides. ... \" Vincent spoke as he lifted his hand to open the Shadow space. ... Soon four Dalki could be seen appearing out in the open. ... The only thing was when they appeared they just stood there in place.'Ah, right Quinn needs to control them.' Vincent thought. ... 'Well, he said he shares his vision with the Demon tier plant thing, so hopefully he can direct them where to go on the whole island, so I hope he can see this and come back soon.'\"Dalki! ... \" Some of them shouted in surprise seeing the beast, even Eno looked a little bit shocked. ... \"I see, the boy has been really busy. ... What a powerful item he has at his disposal. ... Once again he has surpassed my expectations. ... \" Eno complimented the real Quinn, instead of the whoever was in his body. ... \"What about Sil? ... \" Layla asked. ... \"Can't Quinn travel to Alex with his shadow and get Sil? ... \"Sam shook his head, as he released the mistake he had made. ... He was so confident in the teleporters he thought something like this wouldn't have happened. ... \"Alex decided to head with Andrew to one of the Earthborn group planets. ... Apparently Andrew needed to create a few things for their group to help in the battle that was coming up, and Alex asked to go along. ... He has already done so much for us. ... I thought we could grant him this favour and help out Andrew. ... I don't know where he is at the moment. ... The only thing I can do is ask for someone in the Cursed ship to try and locate him and head back to the Cursed ship. ... \"While Sam was delivering the news, It didn't take long for Quinn to notice the presence of the Dalki, so he switched with Vincent for a second, and gave the Dalki simple commands, to head just a little out into the north jungle, and to attack whatever came their way. ... Straight away the Dalki moved. ... \"I've sent the message, all we can do is wait, but we need to act as well. ... \" Sam said, and the rest of the groups were now moving. ... Switching, control back, Vincent was in Quinn's body once again, and only the three of them now remained on the castle roof. ... Vincent, was ready to act, to follow along with these two, but before he could take a step forward, Eno appeared in front of him with his blood armour and looked him directly in the eye. ... \"It's apparent that you're not Quinn, so tell me who you are? ... Why does it feel like I know youâ¦ and you better make sure I like the answer! ... \" Eno demanded. ... âââNow in Full Control of the Roseus tree, Quinn could feel all of the beasts that had been marked over the island, and in the short time he had given it a command, he realised that it had done a far better job than he realised. ... Quinn had an army of beasts at his disposal.'Thank you for all dressing the same. ... You've just made my job a lot easier.' Quinn thought as he gave all the beasts a simple command, to attack the people who were wearing those strange black masks. ... The beasts soon were seen coming out of the jungle, and onto the sand, jumping towards the people in black masks. ... Instantly, they attacked using their blood powers, throwing out their red aura. ... Some beasts were dealt with quickly, while others were strong enough to ignore the first barrage of attacks, charging into their opponents. ... \"What is going on? ... Why are all the beasts suddenly attacking us, this has never happened before! ... \" One of the men shouted, as he punched to slice a beast in half with his red blood aura, but soon a strange thought had come out from one of the trees wrapping around his neck. ... Just like with the amulet, Quinn was able to use his energy to strengthen the Marked. ... Instead of using his own energy, or the one of the tree that was already pretty tapped after taking control over so many beasts, the Vampire Lord had started to drain the lower tier beasts who were close to dying. ... Those that were higher tiers Quinn had decided to give this extra energy he had taken. ... Especially with more difficult opponents. ... It seemed like there were vampires and humans at all different types of levels on the island. ... Sam, Nate and Layla were the first ones to reach their position on the East side. ... It was not too far from where the Demon tier beast was, and they were meant to stick together. ... That's when Nate had spotted a masked person come out from the trees towards them. ... Nate and Sam both were ready to use their blood powers and Layla also had readied an arrow, but soon they saw a gorilla-like beast jump towards the masked invader. ... The beast grabbed the poor man's legs from underneath pulling him onto the ground, and immediately with its large hands it started to pound at the masked man over and over until he was dead. ... The gorilla beast looked at the three of them, and then quickly looked away heading back into the forest. ... \"What the hell was that? ... Did that beast just help us? ... \" Nate asked, rubbing his eyes as if to check if something was wrong with them. ... Layla was the only one who had an idea of what had possibly happened, and it looked like Wevil and Linda who had witnessed the same thing already had figured it out. ... After all, there was one thing on the island that should be able to control beasts aside from Mona. ... \"Does it actually belong to us this time, but how? ... \" Wevil asked. ... \"I don't know, but if I was to guess, my bet is it's something to do with Quinn. ... \" Linda shrugged. ... After a brief conversation, Vincent, Brock and Eno jumped down from the castle, landing in the empty centre where the Demon tree, beast and tablet were. ... \"I see nowâ¦ so the tree was incomplete before. ... No wonder, I could tell that it would do us no harm. ... It looks like I was right to keep it here. ... \" Eno mumbled to himself, as he walked past the tree, and started to head towards the dragon. ... As for Vincent, he still had complicated feelings when thinking about the conversation he just had with Eno.'Quinnâ¦ I'm sorry. ... I don't know what will happen after this fight, but I hope you can forgive me for telling him that. ... It was the only way to make him trust us...'It was then, when Eno had taken one step too far that the Demon tier dragons beast had turned around, and looked towards the three of them. ... Its eyes stared at Eno, Brock and Vincent and it didn't look friendly at all. ... \"You three need to get out NOW! ... The Demon tier beast is no longer listening to me! ... \" Somebody's voice shouted in all three of their heads at the same time. ... Both Richard, and Brock didn't recognise the voice, but Vincent did. ... It was Ray's, and it appeared as the three of them were in for a far tougher job than they had signed up for.*****You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Using the power of the Roseus tree, Quinn was able to coordinate the marked beasts to help out the Cursed faction in holding off the enemy. ... However, at the end of the day, they were just beasts, whereas nearly all of the enemy forces consisted of vampires who had access to super strength, great speed and blood powers. ... It also didn't help that thanks to a certain family that had been on the island for a while now the strongest beasts that the tree had been able to mark were at the King tier. ... Quinn could use the power of the tree to make them somewhat stronger but even that could only do so much against their foes' teamwork. ... Then there were also the stronger vampires who were able to ignore the beasts in the jungle and were heading straight towards the Demon tier beast. ... It was the second line of defence's job to intercept them. ... The group stationed at the East section consisted of Sam, Layla and Nate. ... Although he was the weakest of the bunch, just barely being a noble vampire, Sam stood at the front. ... Nate was also a strong vampire at the noble level, and despite being turned by Sam, had grown to become stronger than him. ... This was why Sam had decided to stay a bit at the back. ... As for Layla, she had scaled one of the trees and took the high ground. ... Looking carefully she noticed some of the trees moving, and quickly held up five fingers on one hand, signalling the two from below. ... \"You haven't learnt how to use Blood Hardening yet, have you? ... \" Nate asked. ... Sam shook his head, a little embarrassed. ... He had only ever learned the basics of using his blood skills. ... While the rest had continuously trained whenever they could, he had been left to deal with the administrative tasks for the Cursed faction, keeping it running. ... It was also the reason why their teams consisted of three members, instead of two like the other groups. ... The first to attack was Layla, as she placed five arrows in her bow and fired them all at once. ... Each one of them had been embedded with Qi. ... As they reached the vampires, one of them had attempted to grab onto the arrow, but it was too powerful for him to hold onto and went straight through his head killing him on the spot. ... Another of the vampires managed to move in time, letting the arrow hit the tree, but seeing this, Layla tried out her new skill. ... Using her telekinesis powers she made the arrow spin, also adding another surge of her Qi.'My body still can't handle the amount of Qi I have, but somehow it's easy enough to share my Qi when I use it in tandem with my telekinesis powers!' Layla's thought distracted her for a brief moment and she ended up putting in a little too much power. ... The whole width of the tree exploded and the arrow carried on heading towards one of the black masked men. ... The masked man was lucky, due to the arrow shaft exploding with the force of Qi, the only thing that had managed to hit him was the arrow head. ... Still, there was one person who wouldn't miss this opportunity, and that was Sam. ... He had been patiently waiting for an opportunity to help out. ... The masked man managed to parry the arrowhead, yet three blood swipes followed closely behind it, hitting him and finishing him off instantly.'My blood powers aren't any weaker than theirs. ... I can still help.' Sam thought. ... As for the other arrows that Layla had fired off, their targets seemed to be more skilled, as they had been able to strike down the arrow at the right time, or hit it with blood attacks of their own, swaying their path.'Looks like there are some strong ones in the group, but there are some strong ones in our group as well.' Layla thought. ... She quickly moved from her position, onto another tree. ... She knew from her training that if she was going to support the group as a marksman, she couldn't afford to stay in one place for too long, otherwise they would find her. ... On top of that, from the initial five that were joining in the fight, more people in the distance could be seen creeping through the jungle. ... For now, she would do whatever she could to injure them as much as possible.'I can do this!'The three that managed to get through, all ran forward at once, and one of them had gone straight for Nate. ... The masked man had its hand clawed and wrapped in blood aura, something Nate hadn't seen before, nor did he know it was something they could do. ... \"Too slow! ... \" Nate shouted, at the right time he stepped forward using a flash step to avoid the strike, and with a fist punched the masked person directly in the face, continuing the contact until the fist and his face were touching the ground beneath them. ... The other vampires soon came to attack him from either side, but he had Blood hardening on his arms, and managed to stop the attacks. ... However, they were faster than Nate had anticipated. ... He was hoping to get rid of two of them, so he could pick off one of them on their own, but now he was forced to block their attacks. ... \"You guys should be ashamed. ... \" Nate smiled, as he continued to block hit after hit from the vampires. ... \"You've been vampires from the beginning, right? ... That means you must have lived far longer than me. ... You had all this time to train your skills, yet this is as far as you got! ... \"At the right time, when one of the foes was ready to attack again, a shadow appeared in front of him stopping his attack, meaning Nate was able to freely go after the other vampire. ... Quickly, moving his head he avoided a punch and grabbed the masked man by the back of the head, before pulling the head down and slamming it into his knee. ... Before they could recover, Nate made sure to use a strike he had been practising from someone he had seen so many times before. ... Throwing out a fist, with a Blood spray, Nate slammed a Blood hammer into the vampire's stomach, making sure he would never get up again. ... Turning around, Nate placed his shadow down expecting to have to deal with one more, but to his surprise he saw Sam there as well, and the other vampire already finished off on the ground. ... \"If their backs are turned and distracted, I can do something on my own. ... \" Sam stated. ... \"You don't have to look after me that much. ... Besides there's something I realised, something that these guys don't have compared to the vampires inside the vampire settlement. ... It might just have been the ones we have fought so far, but I have a feeling it will be true for all of them. ... \"\"What do you mean? ... \" Nate asked. ... \"None of them have any of the vampire abilities that we've witnessed over there. ... They're just using their blood powers. ... \" Sam answered, still unsure what the reason for that was. ... Still, they only had a moment to catch their breath for there were more they needed to deal with. ... Inside the castle, both Raten and Vorden had moved rooms after the roots had come down to attack them. ... They ended up choosing one of the many regular rooms, one that would have been used by the maids. ... Just like before, Borden was guarding both of them, yet this time they were in an even worse state. ... Previously they had been consuming crystals one by one, this way after each crystal was absorbed they could still choose to fight if there was a need, albeit it weakened. ... However, after the attack they had experienced, they started to experiment with consuming many crystals. ... They both found that although the time to absorb the crystals was longer when consuming more than one. ... It was shorter than if they were to do so separately, one by one. ... Which was why, they both had decided to consume all of the crystals and were in the next step. ... How long it would take them to get out of it, and whether they would evolve or not, they didn't know and neither did Borden. ... While watching over the two of them, Borden heard the castle shaking from below. ... It was clear that something had hit the castle and he was wondering what it could have been. ... He looked at the two of them.'No one will suspect that someone is in this room, right?' Borden tried to convince himselfâ¦ but he quickly changed his mind. ... 'No, I have to stay in place! ... I can't disappoint them again!'Choosing to stay, Borden believed he was doing the right thing. ... He reasoned that it might just have been a stray attack from somewhere that had hit the castle, or maybe something else. ... After waiting a while, several bangs could be heard throughout the castle, and each time they were getting louder and louder.'What is going on? ... This can't all just be coincidence. ... If something is in the castle, I have to make sure it won't disturb these two.' Borden thought. ... The banging and crashing was still heard, and as Borden made his way through the castle to try and locate where the noise was coming from it was getting louder and louder. ... Eventually Borden realized that the sound was coming from the dining room. ... Still in his large, adult sized form, Borden decided to form his spikes on his back before entering, listening to his Dalki self. ... Now ready to fight, Borden opened the doors confidently. ... As for what he could see was in the castle, it was a huge surprise to him. ... There were three figures in the room that were breaking and trashing everything they could see in the castle. ... They destroyed every room they had entered, but what was most surprising about them was that they were Dalki. ... \"That one, is the one that attacked Slicer! ... \" One of them pointed at Borden. ... Borden knew he couldn't hold back, because all three of them were three spiked Dalki.*****You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Quinn only had a short amount of time to test the capabilities of the Roseus tree beforehand, but now, forced into this real battle situation, he was quickly picking up new tricks and skills that were helping out with the fight against their enemy. ... For example, while using Full Control on the Demon tier tree itself, he could still continue to give it simple commands as if he was giving someone partial control orders. ... What this meant was that the Vampire Lord could focus on certain parts on the island to help boost creatures and fight against the enemy. ... The masked vampires were getting frustrated as more and more beasts had been coming out of nowhere, since the tree's roots had been marking new one whenever one died off. ... Another difference between the tree and the Demon tier amulet was in regards to the energy transfer. ... The tree actually never seemed to run out of energy, it seemed more like it was allowing the beasts to borrow its energy. ... At first, whenever one beast was close to death, Quinn would drain their energy, but before discovering the ability to delegate some tasks to the tree, he had been unable to drain every creature before its demise. ... However, this did lead him to the realisation that whenever one of the Marked beasts died, the energy inside them would automatically return to the Roseus tree. ... Essentially, the beasts that did remain were able to grow stronger as Quinn continued to give them energy.'No wonder the original Demon tier Tree had been so difficult to deal with. ... I've been wondering how Robin got so strong, even after it had Marked all the others.' Quinn thought to himself. ... Surprisingly, while checking around the island, Quinn discovered one of his fellow comrades who seemed to be on his own... ... only there were actually two tagalongs behind him. ... \"Damn it! ... \" Peter shouted. ... \"I thought I could get a head start and head to where all those ships were to deal with them before they came to the island, but now I have no clue where I'm going. ... I'm lost! ... \"However, even if Peter was lost he still managed to run into his fair share of opponents as well, the only problem was... ... Six masked men had been running through the jungle, they had easily spotted a large pale body from a mile away and had designated him as a target. ... All of them chose to attack, throwing out their blood swipes through the trees. ... They thought their attack was sure to hit, but the pale body avoided all of the strikes. ... Seeing this, the masked men thought it would be best if they attacked head on instead. ... Using their physical strength and vampire powers, they charged in. ... That's when they noticed Peter as well next to the pale body, he had a strange smile on his face as if he was excited. ... Peter crashed his knuckles and cracked his neck turning it side to side.'Finally six of them, maybe these guys will be a m-' Before Peter could finish his thought, he heard something similar to the sound of a whip. ... The masked men didn't quite register what had even happened, as they carried on moving forward, soon finding their upper bodies sliding off from their legs, and eventually falling to the ground.. ... \"Damn it! ... \" Peter shouted. ... \"Legs you keep killing them all before I even get to hit them! ... I know you're just trying to protect me, but I want to have a little bit of fun as well, you know?! ... \"Quinn couldn't believe what he had just witnessed. ... Slicer's legs with the tail were still just as strong as before. ... Not even vampires could match up to it, and Hilston's body was also faster than they could react. ... Seeing this, Quinn thought that maybe Peter really wasn't someone he had to worry about, and decided he could leave him be to do his own thing, while he continued trying to slow down the Masked. ... Inside the castle, Borden had just entered the dining room, only to discover a trio of three spiked Dalki already inside.'It looks like they recognise me from that video. ... Should I feel flattered that Dalki watched it as well?' Borden thought, as he was about to turn away. ... 'There goes my plan to pretend to be one of them. ... Not that I was going to do that for long anyway.'Currently, Borden was a three spiked Dalki, just like the ones in front of him. ... At the time he hadn't noticed it, but during the fight against Slicer he had been so filled with anger, seeing his brother in trouble he had managed to summon a fourth... ... Unfortunately he was unable to do the same at this moment. ... He didn't understand why he was different from other Dalki. ... He could take on a human form while others couldn't, just like he could hide the number of spikes on his back, but it didn't matter, he was different. ... Still, when his body was about to turn around, he heard a voice in his head speak to him.'Are you going to just run away?'The voice was clearly his own, yet somehow just the mere idea of running away annoyed him.'No.' Borden decided as he turned back around, just in time to see an incoming punch from one of the Dalki. ... Moving his head he avoided it, only to counter with a punch of his own, delivering a devastating uppercut to the Dalki's chin, sending it up in the air.'I can't run away, because I am going to protect them! ... I'll kill these guys!' Borden let out a scream. ... He was able to hit the first one, hoping it would be enough to kill the resilient Dalki, whose resilience rivaled zombies at times. ... Borden moved forward hoping to finish off the Dalki, but two more fists came towards him. ... Borden lifted his arms up blocking the attack. ... He could tell that although they were all three spikes, their strength was not on par with his, as he was only forced back a few inches from where he had stood. ... Still, there was a crucial problem, there were three of them and one of him. ... Before he could do anything else, the fist from the second Dalki connected with his stomach, causing him to drop to his, then the third Dalki used his foot to kick him in the headThe first one had also recovered and jumped up to join his companions as Borden gritted his teeth. ... When it was close enough, Borden surprised them all, by lunging at the first one, both of them landing on the floor. ... Only to receive two more hits from the others, now damaging the scales on his body. ... This continued, for every hit Borden was able to get in, he would be hit two times back himself. ... At the same time, even though he was getting stronger with each hit, so was one of them.'I have to do something, otherwise I won't last long against three of them. ... Unless I manage to get to my fourth spike like back then, I'll lose this fight!'His worries started to distract Borden, and the Dalki who had realised that their opponent intended to turn this into a slugfest were smart enough to all start aiming at the same location, the side of his ribs. ... One of them had even decided to claw at it, rather than make a fist, ripping some of Borden's scales off. ... Green blood was now spilling from his side, and he was pretty sure his ribs were broken. ... \"Arghhh! ... \" Borden screamed, ignoring it, and charging in again, he latched onto the Dalki that was injured the most. ... This whole time Borden was aiming for something, he had purposely decided not to hurt the other two as much, and whenever he got the chance to attack the first one, he had used his full strength, judging now was the time. ... Leaving the others alone had been to to weaken their powers, and hurting this one was to put him on the edge. ... Borden, then lifted the Dalki into the air, and over his shoulder, planning to slam it into the ground, but he could see two fists coming his way.'They're going to hit me right after I beat this one... ... and it's going to hurt.' Borden thought but continued with his attack anyway. ... Slamming the Dalki down, it had made a whole in the floor cracking the ground beneath them. ... They were on the bottom floor but what they didn't realise was that there was a whole cave system underneath. ... Now the Dalki had been lost.'Wait, why aren't I getting hurt?' Borden thought, as he had expected to get hit by the other two any second now, but it had never come. ... Looking around the room, he saw a large black furred creature with giant black wings on his back, and a snout-like face with devastating fangs. ... On his forearms, there were also what looked like smaller wings, only folded giving them a strong and sharp look. ... In front of him on the ground was Dalki that was blooded, while another had been hit away into the wall. ... \"Vorden... ... you evolved? ... \" Borden asked in amazement. ... \"Yeah, but I'm not the only one. ... \" Vorden replied with a smirk.*******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "His appearance had changed once again through evolution, but Borden was unsure whether Vorden was now inhabiting the body of a humanoid beast who had evolved into a Demi-god tier beast or whether the crystals they had gathered had been enough to allow Tails to reach the Demon tier level. ... Borden looked over at the two struggling Dalki to get an idea just how powerful Vorden had grown. ... The Dalki that was now covered in green blood, was standing up and the other that had been blasted through the wall was also returning. ... Thankfully it seemed like the one Borden had thrown through the floor wasn't getting back up, which hopefully meant that it was dead. ... \"Ah, I guess I'm still not strong enough to take out a three spiked Dalki in one hit, these guys are super tough. ... \" Vorden stated calmly, his wings on his back started to move slightly, getting ready to be used. ... Jumping back, it looked like Vorden's body was floating for a few seconds as he landed gently by Borden's side. ... \"Even as a Demi-god tier beast it won't be easy for me to match up against this trio of three spikes. ... Borden, I'm going to need your help on this one. ... \" Vorden requested. ... Fortunately, their opponents were on the weaker end among three spikes, so as long as Borden teamed up with his brother, the two of them felt confident in taking them. ... \"What about Raten? ... \" Borden asked. ... \"Is he still going through the evolution process? ... \"With the two Dalki getting closer, Vorden was getting ready to attack, opting to answer Borden's question later, but it was at that moment that a smile appeared on his face, as he realised there would be no need for him to do anything. ... \"Just see for yourself. ... \"The two Dalki were a little shocked by the sudden entrance of a beast. ... However, on their way towards the castle, they had run into many beasts that had attacked them, so they assumed this one would be no different. ... Nevertheless, they remained cautious because this was the first beast that had managed to draw blood on their hard scaled bodies, because of this all of their attention was focused on the Dalki and beast in front of them, that they had failed to notice that both of them could no longer move. ... When they attempted to move their feet, they suddenly felt stuck. ... Looking down, both of them could see that their feet had been encased in some type of mud. ... \"What is this?! ... Why can't we move?! ... \" One of them shouted in anger, but with no momentum and just their power alone they were unable to break through the substance that had appeared below them. ... This was a first for the two Dalki who used their strength to break through everything.'Just how strong is that stuff if it can stop even three spiked Dalki from moving and where did it come from?' Borden wondered, as he hadn't been paying much attention either. ... The next second, a human figure could be seen dropping from above, and at the same time, two large blades were being formed in seconds. ... A liquid mud-like substance could be seen changing shape and forming into the two blades at the last second, until it had pierced right through the top of both the Dalki's heads, like two meat skewers, both of them were no longer moving. ... Now standing, in the middle of the two Dalki, was the mud-like beast. ... \"Raten, you killed them so easily! ... But how is that possible... ... unless you're a... ... \" Borden wasn't too sure about the evolution, since Muddy's appearance hadn't changed as drastically as Tails. ... \"Hahaha... ... hahaha... ... this is GREAT! ... \" Raten loud enough that he risked attracting any nearby Dalki, and that was because he didn't care about this possibility. ... In fact, he was so confident in this new body that he would welcome any to come over to him. ... \"Yeah, your guess is right. ... \" Vorden replied. ... \"Muddy managed to evolve, which means right now Raten is controlling the body of a humanoid Demon tier beast. ... I was worried that even after hunting that many high tier beasts we would lack in crystals, but fortunately Muddy had done a good job on his own. ... \"\"We were also lucky that Tails' body needed far less crystal than we had estimated. ... Since it seemed impossible for me to evolve into a Demon tier, I handed my remaining share over to Raten. ... \" Vorden started to explain. ... \"After we finished our evolution, we noticed that there were Dalki in the castle. ... The first one actually entered our room and Raten dealt with it before I could even help. ... We then split up, he eliminated other Dalki we could hear, and I came to you, since I was worried. ... \"\"According to Muddy, even though his form hasn't changed too much, he now can use a number of different skills he couldn't do before. ... His body can form into a type of soft mud, but when it's hardened it's just as strong as the weapons or shield he made before. ... He can even change his whole body into a mud like substance, even his real form and can practically transform into whatever shape he wants right now. ... \"\"If he wanted to go under doors as just a pile of mud he can, whereas before he could only transform part of his mud and was limited to his human-like appearance. ... \"Although it didn't sound too impressive, Borden, who had been fighting the three spiked Dalki, had just seen it in action. ... The Mud Hardening was able to even restrain their strength, making it extremely useful. ... It was then, that the mud surrounding the Dalkis' legs had joined up with Ratan's body that Borden could see a slight change, the sheer size of Raten was now bulkier, but he soon disperse the mud making small little daggers by his side, and started to mold the mud more and more, putting detail into every little indent in his body, until finally something had happened that not even Vorden had seen coming. ... Both of them were completely shocked by the change. ... \"Y-you now look completely like a.... ... H-human. ... \" Vorden stuttered, still in disbelief and honestly a little jealous. ... Before, Raten with the beast body just had a human-like figure, but one could still see that it was just a beast. ... Now there was so much detail in his appearance. ... Were it not for the strange colour, as well as some missing parts of the human body like lips, Raten could be mistaken for a human. ... He had even molded himself a pair of eyebrows. ... After finishing looking at Raten in awe, the three of them knew they needed to do something. ... They were sure that things must have gone horribly wrong on the outside if the Dalki had managed to infiltrate the castle. ... They were still lacking the whole picture due to staying inside the whole time. ... Borden was quite hurt, and Vorden had offered him an injection, but taking one meant that his body would fully heal, and he would lose access to all the strength his injured body granted him. ... \"I think it might be best if we save that for later. ... I can still fight, and we don't know who else is inside this castle. ... \" Borden rejected his offer. ... Before leaving the place, the three Blades decided to scout the whole area to see if there was anyone else inside. ... It was then that they had found their first vampires that tried to attack them, but dealing with the vampires was a lot easier than the Dalki. ... Going up through the floors they were encountering more, and eventually they had stumbled upon a whole group of masked men who used the red aura powers of the vampire, while another had used an earth ability. ... Vorden found this strange as it was the first ability user they had come across. ... Vorden wanted to test a few things out, for he didn't seem to have super strength or speed like the others either, but Raten had killed the masked man before they could ask him anything.'Dalki, Vampires and now even Humans, all of them are working together to take over this island? ... Just who is our enemy to be able to gather these three different groups under one banner?' Vorden wondered. ... After clearing out the castle, not finding out much in regards to why those people had come here, they decided to head outside, where they could hear the fighting taking place all over. ... \"We should go to Sam and see if he needs our help with anything? ... \" Vorden suggested. ... \"Sure, but do you happen to have ANY idea where Sam currently is? ... \" Raten replied sarcastically since none of them had a way to contact the vampire. ... In the middle of their small argument, they could feel the ground underneath them shake, followed by a loud roaring not too far from them. ... \"This has to be the Demon tier beast. ... \" Borden pointed out. ... \"But why does it sound so... ... angry? ... \"Both Raten and Vorden looked at each other. ... Although both of them were inside the body of a humanoid beast, to them it had just sounded like a beast's roar, so they were wondering how Borden could tell how it was feeling. ... However, Vorden considered that Borden wasn't quite like them. ... He wasn't just half beast, but created using one half of the Demon tier beast that was on this island, so perhaps he shared some connection to it, at least enough to be able to pick up on its emotions. ... \"If it's angry, maybe we should go see why. ... \" Vorden suggested.******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Brock, Eno and Vincent were standing mere meters away from the Demon tier beast that looked like a Dragon. ... Initially, they had been unsure if it was going to attack them or leave them be, as it had just continued staring at them, but once it had let out that almighty roar, they all understood that none of them were welcome anymore. ... When Quinn had gone up to the tablet, Vincent was unable to hear the voice on the other side, but he could hear what Quinn was saying. ... It sounded one sided but he could guess the words that were being spoken and Quinn often updated him on what was happening as he wanted a second opinion. ... However, for the first time, Vincent had heard the voice, and knowing that it didn't come from the other two with him, he was certain that it had come from the tablet itself, meaning it had come from the one that Quinn had called Ray.'Could it be that I can hear the voice because I'm in Quinn's body?' Vincent theorised, however, looking at the two in front, it was clear from their confused looks that they too had heard it. ... Noticing this, he looked past the Dragon to see that the tablet had lit up, just as it had done when Quinn would speak to it, even though at the moment no one was touching it. ... \"Please... ... get out of here! ... \" The voice insisted once more but it started to fade away, and so did the light of the tablet, indicating that it could no longer help. ... Just when the tablet's light had faded the Dragon started to charge towards the three of them. ... With its mighty legs, each step caused the ground to rumble. ... The beast opened its maw wide, revealing the orange light at the back of its throat.'We have to get out of here. ... That Ray guy wouldn't warn us if this wasn't serious. ... Right now, none of us are a match for it. ... Perhaps even the enemy has underestimated the strength of the Demon tier beast!' Vincent thought, as he went to grab onto the one closest to him, Brock. ... The fire was ready to leave the beast's mouth and Eno was a few fingertips away. ... Seeing this, Vincent had no choice, but to use Quinn's shadow to travel, placing both him and Brock in the shadow underneath to move away, yet the ancient vampire stood there unafraid. ... When the flames were about to touch him, the middle spire of his crown started to light up, and soon the rest of his armour did so as well. ... The fire crashed into Eno yet somehow none of it touched him. ... The flames spread as if they were hitting some type of wall, and when looking at Eno, ripples of red aura could be seen in the air contumely moving. ... \"There was no need for you to do that. ... \" Brock stated without looking at his 'rescuer' his gaze fixed at Eno who was blocking the attack. ... \"Excuse me for wanting to help you... ... how was I supposed to know his blood armour could do that? ... \" Vincent replied. ... Blood armour wasn't exactly common, in fact it was rare enough to see someone so much as wear it. ... From his limited experience, he was sure that the set of armour should have great defence, so he had considered the possibility of Eno surviving the attack, yet he had never thought about it being able to create something like a force field. ... \"Granted, you couldn't have known. ... The Vampire King's set, Arthur's set, every blood armour set has a different skill, just like some blood weapons. ... \" Brock nodded. ... Vincent was thinking back to the fight with Cindy. ... How the blood armour had been powered by not just human blood but vampire blood as well. ... To this day, Vincent still wasn't sure what the king's blood armour did, other than radiating a part of the armour, and a strong force being exerted from that area. ... However, he was sure of one thing, that each of the blood armours required blood for their ability to activate, yet Vincent could see none. ... \"As long as we stay behind Richard, we are safe. ... \" Brock repeated. ... Noticing that its flames didn't have the intended effect, the Dragon stopped, but the trail of flames continued, so Eno continued to stand there waiting for the attack to end. ... The Demon tier beast turned around, swinging his gigantic tail at a speed that even a vampire would struggle to keep up with, much less the ancient vampire who was rooted in place,It went through its own flames like it was nothing, the tail was also coming from the side rather than head on. ... Seeing this, Brock's facade changed for the first time to a look of worry.'Is he limited to blocking only attacks from the front or is it because he is still blocking the flames?' Vincent wondered seeing this. ... The next second, the giant tail slammed into Eno and his armour, sending him flying. ... A blur was seen passing through the jungle, and the sound of several trees were heard breaking as he crashed through them one by one. ... It appeared that Eno, who always seemed to have some type of trump card up his sleeve or some secret backup plan, came up short for once. ... In fact, Vincent wouldn't be surprised if he might even be out of this fight altogether. ... \"It looks like it might have been a good thing that me and you were in this shadow, after all. ... \" Vincent cockily noted. ... \"We have to check if the master Is okay, let me out of this place! ... \" Brock demanded, not in the mood for any jabs. ... \"Hold on. ... \" Vincent held him back. ... Now wasn't the time to lose their temper, not when there was still a giant and angry Demon tier beast in their immediate vicinity. ... The two of them had traveled out of the open area, and were looking at everything that was going on from the outskirts of the jungle. ... The Dragon hadn't done much, it had only breathed a single breath of fire and swung its tail, and not even Eno could face something like that with his blood amour. ... It was clear that the two of them stood no chance.'Perhaps by using the shadow powers, I could block one attack. ... Wait, isn't Quinn's Shadow overload skill the answer? ... With the soul weapon active it gives him an unlimited amount of MC cells, as long as he can move the shadow fast enough he could block any attack?'Still, that wouldn't help them defeat the Dragon, they would still be lacking in the fire power department, not to mention their primary goal was to defend the beast, not to defeat it. ... \"Alright, it seems the Dragon has gone back to its usual spot by the tablet. ... It's no longer sleeping like it was before, but I think as long as we stay out of its way, things will be fine. ... It seems to attack anyone that gets too close to it. ... \" Vincent noted. ... Brock found Vincent's conjecture convincing, but right now he couldn't care less about that overgrown lizard, he just wanted to hurry up and check whether Eno was okay. ... Since they didn't have to fear the wrath of the beast any longer, Vincent let go of him. ... \"I'll stay by the Dragon's side. ... Just go and see if the old man is okay. ... Well, I guess we're all old timers, huh. ... \" Vincent chuckled to himself, as the two of them left the shadow to travel and were back in the jungle, not too far from the open area. ... \"Just don't get too close to that Dragon on your way back! ... \" Vincent stressed. ... Brock nodded and was already running off into the direction Eno had been sent to. ... It was easy enough to follow him, given the line of destruction he had left. ... Meanwhile, Vincent remained, waiting to see just how the enemy was planning to capture such a wild beast. ... All blood armour that had been created was strong beyond belief. ... Even Quinn had been unable to put so much as a dent in the blood armour while Cindy had been wearing it. ... He had only managed to damage her body through it, and this was exactly how Eno felt right now. ... To his luck, he had been hit into a cave behind a waterfall, but on his way he had crashed into several trees, eventually recovering mid air he had stopped himself before hitting any of the walls in the cave he was in.'I knew it would have been better to stick to my original plan of moving the Demon tier beast. ... If those brats had only listened to me, we could have simply focused on fighting the enemy in front of us. ... Now we have to worry about the Demon tier beast as well. ... I hate it when I'm stressed out.' Eno thought standing up letting the blood flow out of his mouth, but he soon made a circle motion with his finger, opening up a small portal that looked similar to the ones the ships had come from. ... Putting his hand inside, he pulled out a flask, and started to chug down on the blood inside. ... Surprised, Eno could hear sounds beyond the wall of water that was crashing down in front of him. ... Eno decided to walk towards the cave entrance that was covered by the wall of water falling from above and eventually jumped through it landing on a large rock around the edge of the river. ... There he could see a certain person, calmly walking through the jungle, with two large Dalki by his side. ... \"JIM!!!! ... \" Eno shouted out.******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "There was one more member of the Cursed faction that had arrived with the group, but hadn't been part of any of the plans so far, nor had Eno given him any direction. ... This was because the moment he had arrived, rather than to go through the hidden stash of beast gear Hilston Blade had accumulated, he had been told to do something else. ... While the others had been gleefully searching for treasure, Logan had headed for Blade Island's so-called Temple. ... It was a place where the Blade kids had been forced to learn how to fight and use their abilities. ... As for the reason why Logan was here, it was all because Sam had given him a special mission, a task that only he could do.'Sam's intellect might not be as vast as mine, but his foresight sure is impressive. ... Then again, sending me here was also the obvious choice.' Logan thought, as he was walking through one of the hallways, searching for the best location to start on his little project. ... 'Just like Richard Eno himself, it never hurts to have a back up plan, especially since that man can't be trusted.'The Temple was a large building that was shaped like a square. ... The centre of it was an open field, which the Blade kids had used to practise. ... The other parts of the large square were used as classrooms, filled with all sorts of resources. ... 'This classroom should do.' Logan decided, as he entered one. ... He placed a circular disk on the floor which had a red light in the centre that lit up. ... Once he was done there, Logan also went to the roof of the building, and started to set something else up. ... While he himself was busy with the tools he had brought along, he had made sure to instruct his spiders to be on the lookout throughout the jungle. ... The Temple was considered a relatively safe area, away from beasts, but the journey was not. ... However, thanks to Logan's little spiders he had been able to avoid any trouble, especially since the Blade siblings had done a good job culling their numbers. ... The few times he had ended up running into a beast though, Logan had easily been able to fight it off, or just outright kill it. ... \"That's the fourth one done, now it should be covered by all sides, and I already finished setting up the jammers around the place as well. ... \"Standing up, Logan looked over his work, now there was only one more thing that needed to be done. ... Grabbing a crystal from the large backpack that was carried by what looked like strange robotic spider legs, Logan placed the crystal in the device. ... Fueled by an energy source, it went online and immediately started moving. ... The device itself looked like a robotic turret, and started to move from left to right. ... At the moment, they were set to auto mode, but Logan could also control all of them by using a special pair of glasses that he had brought with him. ... They were also connected to his special suits. ... On all sides of the rectangle building, Logan had set up these special turrets that would fire off energy blasts using the power of crystals. ... Their range wasn't too far, but that was because he didn't want anyone to know he was here in the first place. ... Before setting up the turrets, Logan had picked out certain areas to set up the special teleporter jammers. ... There were two ways to jam the Dalki technology. ... One was to have it built into the teleporter device. ... This had been the case with the teleporter next to the tablet. ... It was designed this way so the Dalki wouldn't get suspicious and it was easy to protect just one item. ... As for the second way, that was what Logan had used inside the Temple. ... They looked similar to the Dalki jammers only that they did the opposite, blocking out the Dalki's teleporter jammers within a certain area. ... Setting these up in hiding spots, now the whole Temple was safe from any type of jammer, even if a couple of them were to be destroyed. ... Heading back inside Logan headed to another room. ... This one was smaller than the others and it only had two desks inside, making him slightly curious what exactly it had been used for. ... Whatever it was, for some reason it had been the one kept in the best shape. ... To his right, he could see plenty of books on the shelves as well as anime stories about superheroes. ... Before starting his work, he heard a loud roar off in the distance, even from where he was. ... \"This is the perfect place to set up the teleporter, and it looks like we might need it. ... \" Logan mumbled as he got to work. ... The special task he had been assigned was to prepare a second teleporter. ... However, it wasn't so others could come and help them. ... No, Sam had made it clear that he wanted Logan to make it work one-way. ... If more people started to appear from the Temple, the enemy might end up targeting that place. ... If their task seemed impossible, this teleporter would act as a last resort to ensure they could retreat! ... After leaving the castle, the Blades decided to head to where they had just heard the loud roar come from. ... They knew they were heading to the other Demon tier beast. ... Perhaps it was overconfidence, but now that Muddy had evolved into a Demon tier beast as well, Raten was sure he could deal with it, if the need arose. ... His siblings showed no fear as they were heading towards it, which was probably the wrong choice. ... Humanoid beasts were meant to be the strongest type of beasts in existence, and Raten was a Demon tier humanoid one. ... This was where some of Raten's logic had come from. ... When seeing it up ahead, Raten charged forward hoping to get to the beast first before the others. ... \"Raten, wait!' Vorden shouted out. ... \"We don't even know if the others are in trouble, the beast could even be helping us! ... \"It was clear to him that Raten just wanted to pick a fight with the beast to prove who was the stronger one of the Demon tier beasts. ... The good thing was, before Raten could leave the jungle, a shadow appeared in front of them, blocking his path. ... What's more a fist filled with red aura came out of it, aimed at Raten's stomach, sending him a few feet back. ... \"Calm down, you idiots, or you'll get us all to be killed! ... \" They were being berated by Vincent. ... The attack hadn't hurt Raten, not that Vincent had his full strength in the first place. ... Even if he had, Muddy's new body was strong enough that a punch without any Qi would hardly be noticed by him. ... The concept of that, was one of the few things that Vincent still hadn't grasped while in Quinn's body. ... Blood powers were something he had known, and getting the hang out of the Shadow power had also been easy, but Qi was something foreign to him. ... Quinn's body might be able to use it, but Vincent hadn't yet figured out how. ... \"The Demon tier beast doesn't seem to attack us as long as we don't come too close to it. ... So it will be in our best interest to make sure none of us enter that open area around it. ... For now we should stay and keep watch. ... \" Vincent explained. ... \"Who are you? ... \" Vorden asked suddenly. ... \"I've known Quinn for a long time, but I've never heard him speak to us like strangers. ... Where is Quinn? ... What have you done to him?! ... \" With Vorden asking these questions, the other two were getting ready for a fight. ... Quinn was still using Full Control on the Roseus tree, but he could see that the beasts he was using were about to be overwhelmed. ... What's more from the looks of it, the roots had already marked all the beasts that had been on the island.'How many of these masked people are there? ... It seems that I have exhausted all the beasts on the island, yet they just keep coming. ... The Cursed faction are doing a good job holding them off, but it seems like it's never ending.'Noticing this, Quinn decided to give a final command to the Roseus tree. ... To supply beasts that were alive with as much energy as possible, and to also protect the Cursed faction members. ... The last ones it had marked shouldn't attack the enemy but focus on protecting the others.'I guess it's time for me to return to my body and see what's happened.' Quinn decided.******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "When Vorden had asked this question, he thought back to the time when they had all been in the Shelter. ... Back then, he had seen Quinn, but not once had his friend used his shadow abilities. ... Even if he had obtained it at some point, that didn't explain the strange way the 'Quinn' before them spoke to them. ... Vorden had gathered that most likely the person that was in control of Quinn before at the Shelter, would be the same person now, but he was interested to find out just who this person was, and was hoping to get an answer. ... The only problem was, Vorden didn't account for the fact that he had two hot headed brothers who were ready for action. ... Immediately after Vorden voiced his doubt about the person in front of them being the actual Cursed faction leader, they considered him to be an enemy. ... The first thing Raten did was liquify parts of his body, sinking mud into the ground, using it to trap the person in front of them. ... They knew how fast and agile Quinn's body was, so if this wasn't a double, but someone who took control over him, it was in their best interest to chain him down. ... It worked perfectly, since Vincent didn't exactly want to fight against them. ... \"Hang on, what are you doing, I'm-\" Before Vincent really had a chance to explain himself, Borden had already thrown out a punch. ... Fortunately the Vampire Lord's body allowed Vincent to see it coming from a mile away. ... He avoided and grabbed onto Broden's wrist. ... \"You know this body doesn't lack in strength when compared to you, and these things can't trap me. ... \" Vincent pointed out, as he sunk into his shadow travel in order to escape from the mud that he was trapped in. ... As soon as he reappeared, Vincent held out his hand ready to fire, as he could see the two beasts coming towards him.'Dealing with them might prove difficult. ... It would be one thing if they were the enemy, but Quinn wouldn't be too happy if I end up hurting his friends!' Vincent was worried about what to do. ... Alas, they didn't seem like the types to listen, not unless he forced them to, after subduing them. ... Luckily, just in that moment, a certain person returned to his own body. ... Quinn was confused since the first thing he saw were two of his friends coming at him, and as they both were inches away from him, Quinn had disappeared, and the two had struck nothing but air. ... A few seconds later, and Quinn had reappeared after using his Shadow lock on himself and this time, he had all of the gear of the Blue Fang armour set. ... \"Have you guys been taken over? ... What's happened! ... \" Quinn demanded an answer, ready to attack them both, currently under the same misconception as the two of them. ... \"Wait! ... \" Vorden called, hoping to explain the situation. ... Out of all the Cursed group members that had split up, there was one group struggling more so than any of the others, and that was Wevil and Linda. ... Both of them used to be the vice leaders of their old factions at one point and having to fight multiple enemies wasn't something uncommon to them at this point, still the sheer number of their opponents was proving too much. ... Wevil could no longer keep up his Tiger Beetle from running out of energy. ... He had great speed but as he tired, the countless masked vampires that had only been a little slower than himself had finally managed to catch up to him.'I need blood.' Wevil thought as he huffed and puffed. ... Soon two masked men were on him with their claws out. ... Wevil hurried to defend himself with his daggers, stabbing one in the thigh and the other at the back of his neck. ... Seconds later, he was hit by a red aura from another direction. ... \"Arghh! ... \" Wevil screamed in pain as his body hurled over. ... The vampire who had been stabbed in the thigh saw his chance and went for the kill with a swipe of his hand, only to be stopped seconds later by a giant club that knocked him away. ... \"Wevil, I'll cover for you! ... \" Linda shouted, but she didn't look much better than her companion, covered in blood, much of it her own. ... Looking at her, Wevil could tell her wounds were no longer healing the same as before and both of them were suffering from the same problem. ... They both needed energy. ... Wevil could obtain new energy from blood, he just needed to touch a human, while Linda needed to consume humans similar to how Peter did. ... In the middle of the chaos it was impossible for them to recharge. ... The Masked attackers just didn't seem to stop coming. ... At first they had been easily able to deal with the groups of five that would appear through the forest, but now more and more were getting through, while they were starting to feel exhausted.'Crap, I just need to find a human, isn't there a single one amongst all those!' Wevil looked around. ... That was when he spotted someone at the very back. ... It was still a masked figure, hiding between some trees.'Why are they staying so far away, are they waiting for us to get weak?' Wevil worried that there was a reason for that person's behaviour and it couldn't be good. ... He picked himself up, but as quickly as he did, his legs felt like jelly causing him to almost fall to the ground again. ... The next second he could see a giant shadow cast over him. ... He looked up and could see Linda's face in front of him.'Is she covering me?' Wevil thought. ... \"I need to tell you something. ... \" Linda said, as she grunted. ... Wevil was wondering what was going on but he was unable to see outside due to Linda's large body. ... In her Great Draugr form she was almost gigantic, larger than a Dalki. ... But he could tell that what was most likely happening was that more enemies had come and they were attacking her right now, and she was the one who was protecting him. ... \"I forgive you Wevil.... ... I blamed you... ... our faction for my brother's death for so long. ... The truth was I got close to you because I was planning to get some sort of revenge on the members of the Parasites, but as I got to know you, I discovered that you weren't as bad a person as I believed. ... That just started to make things so much harder, and I don't know when, but eventually.. ... I .. ... I fell in love with you. ... \" Linda spoke, tears running down her face but due to the hunched position she was in the tears rolled down her eyebrows and onto the ground. ... \"Linda what are you doing, get up! ... Get up! ... \" Wevil screamed, unable to appreciate the giant woman's confession. ... He didn't care for what Linda was saying, all he wanted to do was for the two of them to survive this mess right now. ... The attacks could be heard clearer now, from the outside. ... Although she had a good set of armour, they both saw that she was close to her limit. ... \"Linda, you can't die! ... You can't die for me. ... We have to fight! ... Even if you protect me like this, they'll just kill me afterward! ... Get up, we have to fight! ... Don't you remember what Quinn said? ... This is not worth risking our lives for! ... Are you going to disobey his order!' Wevil screamed at the top of his lungs. ... \"I'm sorry... ... it's too late. ... \" Linda sniffled. ... \"I can't even move my body. ... \"\"Then... ... I'll move you! ... \" Wevil shouted, the strength that was gone from his body was slowly returning. ... He was experiencing some type of second wind as he stood up, and went forward. ... He started to use all his strength pushing Linda's gigantic body up. ... He pushed with all his power, his muscles bulging.'I don't know how long I can stay like this for, but.... ... I have to make sure that at least Linda survives!' Wevil thought as he screamed to further hype himself up, forcing his arms to slightly transform into that of the Tiger Beetle. ... Changing his legs as well, he pushed off the ground springing him up, and Linda's body was lifted off and landed onto the side. ... He now could see the blue sky again, and turned to look at Linda, seeing what might have happened to her, or if she needed help. ... She was now lying on her front, her body was shrinking back down to her regular human size, but the armour hadn't changed for she was too weak to even use her shadow abilities, but at least her eyes didn't look as if she had died. ... Wevil looking at where he was could see a pool of blood, it wasn't his own, but it all belonged to Linda. ... She had given it her all to protect him. ... \"You Bastards!! ... \" Wevil screamed. ... Linda had her hand held out... ... softly saying the words.. ... \"Run.. ... \"For right now, Wevil was surrounded by around a dozen masked men. ... Ironically, he noticed that the one who had been staying at the back this whole time had also moved forward. ... \"Haha, now you come out! ... \" Wevil could tell now that the guy was so close. ... He could sense that this person was human. ... He was exactly what both him and Linda needed to fight a little longer. ... Using whatever he had left, Wevil somehow managed to move his legs. ... His body transformation had reverted after lifting Linda off himself. ... His daggers were on the ground, so charging forward he could do nothing but throw a fist, and at the same time, all the others charged in to intercept him. ... Wevil's hand managed to make contact with something solid, but it wasn't the person in front of him. ... He felt like he had a wall. ... \"I thought you were just a regular human, but you bastard actually had an ability, huh. ... \" Wevil mumbled, accepting his fate. ... He was out of energy, unable to resist as the masked men were tearing into his body. ... Their hands pierced through his stomach, into his chest, into his thigh, blood pouring from Wevil's mouth. ... As much as he wanted to turn around, to see Linda for a final time, he didn't have the strength for it.'Thank you, Quinn... ... the time... ... with you... ... all... ... was... ... enjoy... ... a... ... b-'*****You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Linda was unable to do anything to help Wevil. ... She laid there looking at the end of the person she had once hated, but who she had ended up falling in love with. ... Last time, she had been unable to help her brother Blip, blaming herself for him having lost his life. ... Nothing seemed to have changed. ... Despite all the power she was supposed to have at her disposal, there she was failing to save a loved one once again. ... She wanted to stretch out her arm towards Wevil, yet the only degree of movement she had in her was a slight twitch of her fingers. ... With the many wounds he had suffered it seemed impossible for him to have survived and the masked men weren't stopping, like ravenous beasts who had found food for the first time in weeks. ... Even though he was standing it seemed like it was only because of the others who were holding him up with their attacks. ... Just as they had removed their hands from his body, Wevil's body flopped to the ground, showing no indication of life inside it.'No! ... No!' Linda screamed in her head again. ... She was hoping to summon some type of surge in energy, similar to how little Wevil had been able to lift her gigantic body. ... If she had been able to stay on top of him then perhaps he would have been the one to have survived. ... Yet here she was still unable to move, her MC cells had been spent, so she could do nothing. ... After dealing with Wevil, the masked men started to come towards her, and through the jungle more men were starting to appear.'Quinn, where are you... ... weren't you meant to protect us? ... I thought you could feel it... ... Is that why you haven't come yet? ... Could it be Wevil isn't.... ... he isn't... ... dead.' Despite considering that possibility, deep down she knew that shouldn't be the case. ... As resilient as vampires and their subclasses might be, even Peter was unlikely to survive this degree of damage. ... \"Where the hell are you, Quinn?! ... You should be here!! ... \" Linda screamed at the top of lungs while squinting her eyes shut. ... She had used her last breath and no longer knew what was happening anymore, as she closed her eyes, part of her looking forward to reuniting with Wevil. ... However, after a while she could hear the sound of fighting.'What is going on?' She thought. ... Her energy was still weak so it was hard for her to open them, and eventually the fighting that she could hear had stopped nearly just as quickly as it had started.'I guess I must have passed out for a few seconds... ... whoever they were fighting stopped.'\"Here, eat this! ... It should help you regain some of your strength. ... \" A voice ordered her. ... She was too weak to recognise it. ... The owner of the voice seemed to have noticed that Linda was too weak. ... The next moment she felt something pressed against her lips, and before she processed what her own body was doing, she realised she had already started eating whatever it was in front of her. ... Energy started to gather inside her body, and her wounds began to heal once again. ... Finally, she had enough strength to open her eyes, and that's when she could see it. ... Around twenty masked men had been slaughtered, their limbs removed from their body. ... One in particular looked like they had been cut. ... When looking down, Linda noticed she had nothing but a human bone from an arm in her hand. ... \"Flesh, but how, weren't they all vampires? ... \" Linda questioned. ... \"Not all. ... \" The person next to her replied. ... Turning her head she soon could see a large black furred beast. ... \"Vorden! ... \"\"Calm down, even though you have eaten enough to recover your energy, it will still take some time for your body to heal. ... It looks like you really did push yourself beyond what you were cable off. ... Honestly, I don't think you can fight anymore, even if you ate more. ... \" Vorden spoke to her, although he wasn't entirely sure if that was true since he wasn't a Vampire himself. ... He was mostly basing his knowledge on what he knew about Peter. ... \"There's not just vampires among their group, there are also humans. ... Although rare, they're dangerous since they can use abilities. ... Oh, and they're also Dalki on the island. ... \"Linda looked shocked to hear this, and she realised now where the arm she had gotten must have come from. ... \"Wait, if you were able to get to me in time, does that mean!'' Linda sprung up, to look in the direction of where she last saw Wevil. ... However, Vorden quickly blocked her view, shaking his head. ... In the few seconds she had managed to look over there, she couldn't see Wevil's body, but judging by the way Vorden was reacting, it was clear that he hadn't survived. ... Almost immediately, Linda started to feel weak again, and she lent up placing her head into Vorden's chest. ... \"He didn't deserve to die! ... Why him? ... Why?! ... Vorden, tell me! ... Why are we the only ones fighting on this damn island! ... Why are we the ones losing people all the time! ... And where is... ... where is.... ... \"\"Quinn? ... \" Vorden finished her sentence for her not wanting her to speak or use up any more energy. ... \"Quinn was actually the one who sent us here. ... He could tell that you guys were struggling but he had to attend to something else, and Linda this war... ... hasn't been good for any of us. ... \"\"How many lives have already been lost, and how many more will be lost... ... I'm afraid we'll need to strengthen our resolve. ... This might not be the only loss we suffer this war, however he won't be forgotten. ... Wevil fought with his life for us, for the Cursed faction, for the human race. ... \"\"We need to make sure that he gave his life for a reason. ... You in particular Linda. ... I haven't been back with the Cursed faction for long, but I could tell that Wevil was always looking out for you. ... \"Linda fell down once again, falling to the ground, but unfortunately they didn't have the luxury of time to allow her to grieve. ... The enemy was still on the move through the jungle, and Vorden, knowing this, grabbed onto Linda, flying back. ... \"Wait! ... \" Linda cried out. ... \"What about Wevil's body, where is it? ... \"\"Wevil's body is being returned to the castle at the moment. ... Remember how I said we? ... The one that killed all those masked wasn't me Linda, it was Raten. ... Borden will take his body back to the Castle. ... I would never allow someone who fought so hard like that to get trampled or used for other means. ... \"\"I think it's best if we return as well Linda, take a break and rest for now, leave them to us. ... \"Hearing these words, Linda soon closed her eyes and her exhaustion made her enter a deep sleep. ... Despite how fast Vorden was moving, and her having eaten, it was as if her mind had shut down with everything she had been through. ... While travelling back to the castle, seeing Wevil's body before it was taken away. ... Vorden felt his arms constantly tensing as his blood boiled with anger. ... He was starting to worry whether they could actually win this fight and if so... ... just how high would the cost be that they would have to pay? ... Even with him and Raten having evolved, he couldn't help but wonder if it was worth it.'Maybe the best thing to do is give up the fight for now. ... Otherwise, more of us will lose our lives in this, but can we even do that, how do we even get out of here?'At this moment, there was another Cursed faction group that was doing well up to a certain point, but now they were struggling as well. ... In this group, there was Fex, and Dennis who too had used their powers far more than they thought and were beginning to tire out. ... At the moment, there were three of them, standing back to back. ... As for the third person, or being with them. ... It was a white haired gorilla with four arms. ... One of the Marked beasts being controlled by Quinn, who had been a great help to them so far. ... There were other beasts originally by their side but now they had all been killed apart from one. ... The whole group were surrounded by a mixture of vampires and humans and the group had become incredibly large in number reaching over forty. ... \"Do you think this is where our grave will be? ... \" Dennis asked. ... At first they had been faring well, having already defeated around the same number surrounding them now, but as soon as they got tired, it was almost as if they were relying on their other allies to come and help. ... \"Don't speak like that, Old man. ... I'm not dying here, I have far too many things I need to do! ... \" Fex shouted as he took the box off from his back that he had been carrying around the whole time and slammed it on the ground. ... \"It's time to put this to use! ... \"******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "As a society based on strength, many vampires looked down on those who used tools to show off their strength. ... It was why many of them refused to use beast gear, even though some had voiced that this sentiment seemed contradictory since their ancestors used blood weapons. ... However, certain vampires felt like this was still part of their strength since they were created from crystals that could only be obtained from vampires, rather than borrowing it from mere beasts. ... However, despite this belief, neither the regular nor the vampires in a family would look down upon the members of the thirteenth family, who were considered to be a strong family. ... Nonetheless, their real strength stemmed from their ability, for which they needed a tool, one that only their top members possessed and that was something called a puppet. ... Of course that had not always been the case. ... In fact, in the past they had been mocked because of it. ... One day, an argument had escalated to the point that the family leaders had been forced to get involved. ... Picking one of the many families that had publicly mocked the thirteenth family's ways, he had called for a duel to settle the matter once and for all. ... The Vampire King himself had come to observe the fight, just like all the other family leaders. ... The thirteenth family leader had done something no one had expected. ... Using his strings he grabbed one of the Vampire knights from the very leader he was about to face. ... At first the other leader had scoffed at the thirteen's actions, believing that the other had done so to make him hesitate, however he did no such thing. ... With his first attack, he made it clear that he would not be holding back, but what happened next was a tale that would be told within the thirteenth family for centuries. ... Using his strings, the thirteenth leader proved to be so skillful in controlling the Vampire knight puppet that he managed to make his opponent yield. ... A Vampire knight of the same family being able to to beat his own leader was something unheard of. ... It was such a huge embarrassment for the family that the leader was forced to go into eternal slumber to save face. ... From that day on, vampires stopped regarding a puppet as a type of tool, instead treating it as the real trump card of the thirteenth family and the proper way for how the string ability was meant to be used. ... Ever since, the higher members of the thirteenth family spent much of their time mastering that art, and that included Fex. ... After slamming the coffin-like box that was on his back on the ground, the lid fell to the floor, and a human male could be seen inside. ... \"Alright, Agent 11, it's time to do your work! ... \" Fex shouted, as he kicked the box down and quickly threw needles tied with his strings towards the man, and started to summon his blood weapon right after. ... Once it was in Fex's hands he wasted no time stabbing Agent 11 in the back. ... \"Ahhh! ... What the hell is going on! ... \" Agent 11 cried out, after seeing the outside light for the first time in a long while. ... He had only been able to hear noises from inside the box, so he was confused about what was going on. ... His freedom was short-lived, as he got stabbed by Fex, finding himself surrounded by blood thirsty killers on all sides. ... \"Look, you want to live, right?! ... Well if I die, you die. ... As you can see, those aren't your Pure buddies who have come to save you. ... Use your Qi or whatever else you have in store with your sword, and just let me do the rest! ... \" Fex ordered. ... The one that Fex was using as his puppet right now, was the Pure agent they had captured. ... Fex had never been able to use his Influence skill on, which was the reason for capturing him in the first place. ... Although, even Quinn had been unable to bypass his mental defenses, the group had decided to keep him prisoner, for one he had tried to kill their members and the second reason, they thought they might eventually find a way to get information out of him at some point. ... It was then that Fex had come up with another use for him. ... Agent 11 had a strong body, and was able to use the power of Qi, not to mention he was close enough to being a single agent, the strongest type in Pure. ... Fex had briefly tested him out with his puppeteering skills and he had turned out better than the vampire had imagined. ... During this fight, for the first time Agent 11 would be even stronger thanks to his blood weapon. ... The masked men, seeing one more person who wasn't an ally, started to charge in. ... Agent 11 had no choice, tightly gripping onto the sword in his hand, he channeled his Qi through it. ... \"Just focus on your Qi, relax your body and let me do the rest! ... \" Fex shouted. ... It was a hard thing to do, especially since Agent 11 could see someone charge at him, but he knew what Fex meant. ... Agent 11 had reluctantly been used as Fex's practice tool on his downtime, and he knew that it was worse for him to go against the flow. ... Soon, using his sword, a slash even faster than Agent 11 was ever capable of using, sliced the masked man's hand off. ... The vampire swivelled around holding his arm, and noticed that the wound wasn't healing.'Haha, I hope you enjoy this surprise. ... It looks like you guys have never fought against someone who can use Qi before.' Fex thought gleefully as he continued to control Agent 11. ... With his sword, he sliced the vampires in his way, thrusted them down, and finished most of them with a single strike to the point where they could no longer get up. ... As for the other side, they too had decided to charge towards Dennis, but now that Fex was able to deal with a majority of them, Dennis' load had lessened. ... The gorilla was able to help out massively, as it leapt through the air, slamming its giant fists on two of them, and then using its smaller arms underneath to continue to punch the vampires on the ground. ... \"I'm not going to lose out to a freaking gorilla! ... \" Dennis shouted, as he went forward and continued to fight with his fists as well. ... He had used up his MC cells, unable to cast his shadow ability, which was why his fighting had also turned more beast-like. ... He continued to punch, with the gorilla, and held off the enemies in front of him. ... Eventually, Dennis had slipped on some blood and caught himself but was now down on one knee. ... A masked vampire saw this as the right time, throwing a claw towards the back of Dennis' head. ... Reaching out the vampire was inches away before a burning sensation was felt on its head, and soon it fell to the floor, before it succeeded in its attack.'What was that, acid?' Dennis wondered, as he continued to fight, and glanced at the tree where the attack had come from. ... There he could see that there was a snake-like beast in the tree, and now it was helping them as well. ... Shooting out acid towards the masked on the ground. ... \"I don't know who is controlling these beasts, but I'm going to have to thank them! ... \"With excitement and support by his side, Dennis was feeling invincible, ignoring the wounds that he had received, just focusing on the fight. ... He was pushing himself beyond what his body was already capable of. ... Pain was a sign for the body to stop what it was doing, to tell it, that it was in trouble and as a result, Dennis didn't realise just how much he had been hurt. ... When going to punch someone, he was a few seconds slower as his rib cage had been cracked from an earlier hit, and it looked like the few remaining vampires noticed this as well, ready to at least take one of them down.'Crap... ... I didn't get to... ... I didn't get to even spend that week off with Megan.' Was going through Dennis' mind as he saw the fists coming towards him, almost in slow motion, but there was nothing he could do about them. ... \"You're not dying on my watch, old man! ... \" Fex shouted, running across Dennis' back, and kicking two of the vampires' heads in front of him. ... Fex then quickly pulled one forward with his string and sliced it from the head down in half finishing the last few remaining ones. ... Dennis, seeing Fex back could see that his black needle was in his back. ... \"What happened to them? ... Huh? ... \" Dennis said, confused. ... \"That guy is good enough to handle himself. ... After dealing with most of them, I let him do his own thing and used the power of the needle on me. ... \" Fex replied. ... Eventually the group had dealt with all forty of the masked men. ... With this brief break it looked like no more masks were coming in their direction. ... They wondered if it was because the enemy thought that they would be finished by now, or had they really defeated all those coming from this direction. ... Either way, they had time to rest and with the humans they had killed, both Dennis and Fex consumed their blood as they started to recover. ... Eventually, Fex picked up the wooden crate that was still in good condition. ... \"Alright, we should be good now. ... Come on, you know the drill. ... \" Fex clapped his hands looking at Agent 11. ... \"Seriously? ... I just saved your asses! ... Heck, I didn't even try to run away, yet you want me to return to that stuffy box? ... When's the last time you even cleaned it! ... \" Agent 11 wasn't too keen to listen to that order. ... \"Oh please, where would you have even run off to? ... We're on an island with all sorts of people trying to kill us. ... Just get in the box! ... \" Fex ordered, getting his strings ready. ... \"Look, I promise I will help you guys, just don't put me back in there! ... I won't resist if you control me, or puppet me or anything! ... We both know that if it wasn't for me, he would have died and you should at least reward me for that right? ... \" Agent 11 argued, pointing towards Dennis. ... \"Just let him stay outside. ... He did help us after all. ... \" Dennis took his side, relaxing and allowing the blood to heal their wounds. ... \"Argh, fine! ... But just this once, and don't even think about getting away! ... \" Fex loocked eyes with the gorilla that was still alive. ... \"Gorilla, keep an eye on him. ... \"Fex was annoyed, but at the same time worried that Pure Agent was just waiting for a better opportunity to make a run for it. ... It had taken him a long time to find someone this good he could use, but it looked like Agent 11 was staying close by. ... Fex decided to go up to his attackers hoping to get a good look at them and one was lying in the grass.'Why do they even wear these masks, is it to cover up their ugly faces?' Fex thought, taking one of them off, revealing the man's face.'He's not ugly enough to need a mask, in fact he's actually quite handsome. ... I wonder why they all use those masks then? ... I don't recognize this guy. ... \" Fex thought, thinking it was one of the agents from the Vampire World. ... Not that Fex did know every single vampire in the settlement. ... Out of curiosity, Fex decided to go to another masked man and took his off as well, and when he did, he had to rub his eyes twice because he couldn't believe what he was seeing.. ... \"What the... ... were those two twins? ... \"*****You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "After seeing the second person's face under the strange black mask all of them seemed to wear, something about it bothered Fex. ... Both of them looked identical... ... too identical even if they happened to be twins. ... Setting aside the small likelihood that the vampire just so happened to unmask two brothers, there was another explanation for their resemblance. ... Fex gulped as he considered that possibility. ... He quickly went over to another masked man on the ground and started to pull his masks off as well. ... Dennis, Agent 11 and the gorilla were watching his strange actions from the side as they took a break to recover, wondering why he was acting like some type of mad man. ... However, after they saw him pull off the sixth person's mask, they looked past his actions and were now looking at the details on his face. ... He was sweating, something vampires didn't really do, not even when tired, which meant most likely something was worrying him. ... \"They're the exact same! ... \" Fex shouted in frustration. ... \"All these masked men are the same! ... All of them must be clones of the same person. ... \"Dennis finally got up to have a look at just what Fex was talking about. ... He was half hoping that perhaps the people just looked similar or that the other had just revealed the faces of identical sixtuplets, but their resemblance was uncanny. ... The group dragged the corpses of those men next to each other, so they could get a closer look and a better comparison. ... However, it just made things even stranger because from head to toe, all the men were identical even in height. ... \"They must be clones! ... Didn't Quinn say that Eno could do the same? ... He also had multiple copies of himself. ... \" Dennis assumed and started to sniff the air. ... He had another thought and wanted to check something out. ... Following his nose, it soon brought him to another masked person that Fex had yet to pull the mask off. ... After finding six people with the same face in the row, Fex didn't expect to see anything different from the others.'It would make sense, I guess. ... If Richard could do it, his relatives might be able to aswelll, given that they should have the same power.' Dennis thought. ... If Fex was to concentrate, he could still hear the sounds of fighting coming off from different directions. ... He knew that Richard could create clones, but this many? ... \"For frick's sake, this whole time, we've been fighting against bloody clones! ... \" Fex continued shouting and cursing. ... \"How is this fair? ... These guys aren't even real! ... No wonder there are so many of them! ... We have to fight with our lives on the line while they can just as easily be replaced!!! ... \"Eventually, Dennis had found his resolve to pull off the mask from the person in front of him, and what he saw underneath was finally something different to the other masked person. ... There was a woman who was already dead but there was something else that was different about her compared to the others as well. ... \"Come over here! ... \" Dennis called out. ... Out of interest, the gorilla and even Agent 11 had come over. ... The Pure Agent wasn't sure why exactly Fex and the others were on the island, but from what he had gathered they seemed to be up against what the world knew as V at the moment. ... He had seen their red eyes and powers. ... If he actually got a chance to escape he could use all of this information to rise within the Pure organization. ... \"This one's... ... a human. ... \" Fex sniffed the air to make sure, but he also remembered something else looking at the specific wound on her body. ... He had been the one to have killed her. ... Fex remembered this person well because she had been the only one that had used an ability against him. ... \"Wait, is that the reason? ... \" Fex spoke his thoughts out loud. ... \"We've fought against so many vampires, but none of them seemed to have an ability? ... \"\"I've seen some vampires who don't have abilities. ... Is it that strange? ... \" Dennis asked. ... \"Even in the pooling area, vampires chose different abilities from the thirteenth family, only those who haven't given up on a promotion would choose not to learn any ability. ... \"\"So you think the humans aren't clones? ... Do you think they abducted them, because clones can't learn abilities? ... \" Dennis wondered. ... \"Couldn't it just be a case of those ones being created recently? ... \" Agent 11 chimed in with his own opinion on the matter, mostly because he didn't have anything better to do and he was aware that he would literally get dragged into the Cursed faction's mess. ... \"If all your enemy needed was an army to overwhelm you guys, would he have bothered to prepare for it for a long time to teach them all abilities, or to find them? ... Perhaps it's more correct to say that whoever made these clones is unable to copy them with abilities in the first place. ... Otherwise he coudl teach one person an abaility and then clone them. ... Then again I'm no scientist. ... \"While they were all busy thinking about how this information could possibly help them in their current fight, they could soon hear another wave of people coming towards them. ... \"Well I guess they aren't short on numbers, and I guess unlike us they don't really have to care about any losses. ... \" Dennis stretched his arms behind his back a few times, he could tell his body hadn't made a complete recovery yet and although blood from humans allowed them to heal, restoring their energy and stamina was another thing altogether. ... Out from the large jungle trees, they could see more masked men appearing. ... Just like they had suspected it was another group. ... \"Isn't something a little off about them? ... \" Fex asked moving in closer to where the others were, also twirling his fingers getting ready to attach them to Agent 11 at any moment. ... As they got closer, Agent 11 noticed it as well, some of the masks they were wearing were cracked and at the same time they had wounds and blood dripping on their clothing. ... Before the group even reached them, the snake beast that helped them from before dropped from above, landing on three of them. ... It let out its acid on a the other members, and all of the other Masked had fallen, but they seemed to be ignoring the snake that had just landed on some of them. ... On closer inspection, they looked to be in a hurry as they scuffled to try and continue running. ... Before they knew it, a figure could be seen landing in front of the group, and as quickly as it landed, it dealt with the rest of the Masked, with a few hits.'Isn't that Mona, one of the former Big Four? ... What is she doing here, in a place like this' Agent 11 was beyond shocked. ... Mona turned around after dealing with them, and the snake that was on the ground slivered up and went around her neck. ... When turning she looked at those in front of her, and noticed how tired and torn their clothing were. ... \"I'm sorry. ... I was confident that I could stop them from coming and I was faring well with the Kraken beast. ... They just kept coming and coming, it felt like they were... ... \"\"Endless. ... \" Dennis finished her sentence. ... \"We've experienced the same thing. ... We're just happy that you took care of many of them and I think everyone on this island will agree. ... What happened to the beast that was with you? ... \"Mona was a strong woman who was usually brimming with confidence, but when asked this question the others found it strange that this confidence had vanished from her face, and they weren't sure if they were imagining it or not, but could see her shudder slightly. ... \"The Kraken... ... it's dead. ... \" Mona answered, looking away from the others, her eyes full of pain. ... \"I guess, not even a Demon tier beast can handle an army of vampires. ... \" Fex noted, almost proud of this fact. ... \"No, it wasn't done by the Masked. ... \" Mona replied. ... \"It was something else. ... Honestly, I'm not sure I should tell you, guys... ... it might make you give up on this fight as well... ... Do you think it's too late for all of us to give up on this mission? ... \"All of them were wondering just what Mona could have seen, that could convince her that retreat might actually be the best option.******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Out of all the Cursed groups that had split up, one was faring a lot better compared to the others and that was Sam's group. ... Most of this was actually thanks to the synergy between Layla and Nate. ... With her acting as the group's marksman, now that she had improved her powers she could injure most of the Masked before they got too close. ... Nate would be there to fight off those who had evaded her attacks, while allowing Sam to pick off the weaker ones in the back. ... Layla was able to freely change between her three forms, so whenever they had a short break, she would transform into her third form, allowing her use the special flames to heal any injuries Nate and Sam, while also renewing their buffs. ... There were a few times that they had struggled, in particular whenever the Masked had attacked with ability users in their midst. ... However, for those occasions, they had an ace in the team that their enemy had no way of dealing with, which was, once again, Layla. ... Whenever they came across a troublesome ability user, Layla would quickly change into her second form and join the fray from up close. ... This would put more pressure on Nate and Sam, but a few four legged beasts also had come to their aid to help them fight. ... None of the ability users were prepared to go up against someone who was capable of negating every single ability there was out there, making it easy for the young woman to finish off the troublesome ones.'This is the power of having real support on our team.' Sam realised as they struggled through a new wave of Masked. ... 'If we'll ever have to fight this type of battle again, it would be best if we had more supportive abilities to help out the groups. ... \"'Howeverâ¦ just how many of those Masked are there? ... No matter how many we kill, their number doesn't seem to drop. ... If anything I think they're getting more numerous with each new wave. ... I'm not sure if the other two have noticed it, but each time we're getting pushed further back.'\"Sam! ... \" Nate called out. ... \"I'm nearly out of blood. ... My flask is practically empty. ... \"This was another problem. ... Although Nate's stamina was great, better than most in the Cursed faction, and although nearly none of them had been injured, there was the issue of blood. ... Using their blood abilities allowed Sam and Nate to perform strong attacks, but without blood not only would it make them weaker they could no longer produce their red aura. ... \"Let's head closer to the castle! ... \" Sam ordered. ... Everyone started to slowly retreat. ... With no end in sight, Sam was trying to figure out how they would win this. ... After all, their victory condition was having to make sure the enemy didn't get the Demon tier beast. ... Unfortunately, he lacked critical information about how the other sides were doing, and he had a strange feeling not too long ago, he didn't think it was a good sign. ... As the group was moving back, Sam could feel the back of his hair move violently, as if a storm was coming. ... He had a premonition that it might be dangerous to turn around, but his fear that it could be the enemy made him take a quick look, only to see a black feathered beast he hadn't seen before. ... \"Sam, we need a new plan! ... \" The beast shouted, that he recognised as sort of Vorden's. ... \"I know, but it's kinda hard to come up with something, while we're surrounded by the enemy! ... \" Sam replied back, slightly annoyed with the tone Vorden had given the second he had arrived. ... Before Sam could say anything else, another strange creature ran past him, also passing Nate and Layla as well. ... Turning around, they could see that it looked like a person, who wore the same black clothing as the Masked. ... However, he seemed to have cut off the sleeves of the clothing. ... The next moment they saw why, as both his hands formed into two gigantic blades. ... The second the strange person had disappeared into the jungle, he started to slice down all of the Masked one by one. ... Most of them weren't even able to retaliate, as for those who did, their red aura proved to do nothing to the assailant. ... \"Raten can deal with any of the Masked that come our way. ... Now, how about we talk? ... \" Vorden asked again. ... Hearing who the strange person was, Sam could only reach one conclusion which was that Raten must have evolved and was now inside the body of humanoid Demon tier beast. ... With this revelation, Sam believed that they might have a chance. ... \"Quin just sent us over to Wevil's group. ... He's dead and Linda can no longer fight. ... Borden should have brought his body back to the castle and is probably looking after Linda now. ... This fightâ¦ it's worse than we thought. ... Apart from the Masked, there're also Dalki! ... \"\"Judging by the look on your face, I assume you must have thought that with me and Raten having evolved we might stand a chance of winning this, right? ... \" Vorden asked. ... \"I thought the same, until I saw what state Linda was in. ... \"\"Even if we can win this fight, we might even be lucky if more than a few of us will actually survive. ... Quinn was right, Eno doesn't care about us. ... We need a better plan! ... \"Sam had mixed feelings after hearing the news. ... He had prepared himself for the possibility that some of the Cursed faction were going to die after finding out who they were going up against, knowing the enemy would surely have some tricks up their sleeves, but it still felt surreal at the moment. ... Worst of all, he didn't even have time to grieve over Wevil because Sam needed to think up their next course of action to prevent anymore losses. ... \"There's more news! ... \" Fex shouted over. ... Towards the castle, the heavy grown jungle area lessened. ... The trees and grass were thinned out, giving a more open area allowing for everyone to see each other easier. ... When turning around. ... Sam could see Fex and the rest with them. ... He found it strange they were travelling with a gorilla, but when seeing Mona, and considering the beasts that had helped them at the cost of their own lives, Sam didn't find it too strange anymore. ... With the three groups meeting up, and Raten in the jungle making sure no one got close to the castle, all of them shared the information they had gathered. ... There were three key points to take note of. ... First, nearly all of the Masked they were facing were clones. ... If Richard could create clones it made sense that Jim could as well, but one question popped up in all their heads. ... Where exactly were Richard Eno's clones right now? ... The information brought from Vorden was that there were also Dalki here, which they had predicted would come at some point. ... Additionally, he had brought the sad news of Wevil's death. ... Everyone went silent for a moment before they continued to talk again, but the worst piece of news by far was the news that Mona had brought them. ... It was because of this, Sam had made the decision. ... \"We have to give up on the Demon tier beast. ... \" Sam concluded. ... \"We will leave this island. ... I thought that the location of the teleporter was subpar, so I had Logan create another one just in case. ... If he hasn't finished it yet, I don't think he will need much longer. ... Most of us are weak and can't continue fighting, it's the only thing we can do. ... \"\"The teleporter is at the Temple. ... \"\"What about Quinn? ... \" Fex asked. ... \"Don't we need to tell him as well? ... What's he even doing at the moment? ... \"Just as Fex had asked that question, a loud roar from the Dragon was heard. ... Since they were close it felt like they could feel its power just from the roar it had made. ... \"We can inform Quinn he will come, but he has something important to do first. ... \" Vorden answered. ... A while ago, Quinn had gotten his body back from Vincent, only to find himself facing the trio of Blades. ... As the three of them were together, Quinn could feel something, a couple of his connections, his links to those that he turned were in trouble. ... It still hadn't gotten to the point where it was life threatening but he knew they needed help. ... He was about to go himself, but as he was, a voice spoke to him once again. ... The tablet not too far from where they were had lit up once more but the voice when it spoke sounded weaker than it ever had done before. ... \"Quinn! ... Quinn can you hear me? ... It's Ray! ... \" The voice must have been shouting, but all Quinn could hear was a faint whisper. ... \"I've been watching everything that has been going on, and I'm here to tell you that you can't win this fight! ... Not the way you are right now! ... \"\"If you stay here, you and all your people will lose their lives for nothing. ... You have to leave this island! ... I thought you had a chance since you seem to possess a certain amount of strength, but I've just felt something far stronger than you out there! ... \"\"There is a chance that once you leave this island that they will also destroy it. ... Even if they don't they may certainly take an interest in this tablet. ... If that is the case, if I get destroyed then... ... I can't fathom what will happen to this world and its abilities. ... Most likely, it will leave the human race with no chance at all. ... \"Listening to what Ray had to say, Quinn believed it, mainly because he could tell from his connections how certain members of his were struggling. ... \"I've seen your shadow power, perhaps there is a way you can place the tablet in your shadow. ... Please, if at all possible, YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THE TABL-!!!. ... \"The glow of the tablet went down once again, but Ray had said enough for Quinn to take him seriously.'Take the tablet with us? ... That's easier said than done. ... I doubt the Dragon will just let me take it, even if I ask him nicely...'******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "\"We have to help him! ... \" Layla insisted after finding out what Quinn was currently doing. ... \"We couldn't do anything against that Dragon last time, so Quinn will surely need our help! ... \"\"I don't think Quinn is reckless enough to give up his life, Layla. ... Besides, do you really think you can help him? ... \" Vorden asked, his tone harsher than he had intended. ... \"Honestly, we all have gotten stronger and I know you've been training hard, but we're already hard pressed to deal with all of the Masked. ... Eventually, even Raten will tire out and they will storm this castle and the rest of the areas. ... \"The others didn't say anything. ... They too wanted to help Quinn, but wondered what use they would be if they headed over. ... Those who knew him were aware that Vorden would never abandon his best friend, so the decision to stay out of his way couldn't have come lightly. ... \"Vorden is right. ... \" Sam agreed, breaking the silence. ... \"Quinn has the highest chance of survival out of all of us. ... Given his Shadow ability, he'll be able to flee if left with no other choice. ... Our situation is different, though. ... We need to go through the second teleporter to get off this island and I suggest we do so now, before anything unforeseen happens. ... \"Although it was obvious that Layla wasn't pleased by this outcome, she understood that time was of the essence. ... Before heading to the Temple, they all decided to stop by the castle to gather Wevil's body and Linda. ... \"Hey, did any of you see Peter? ... \" Nate suddenly asked, before they set out. ... They all looked at each other and realised that the last time they had seen him was when he was digging through Hilston's things. ... After that point, they had lost him. ... Just where had he run off to during this whole mess? ... Most importantly, was he still safe and okay? ... Sam tried to call Peter on his communicator, but it looked like communication down on the island as well. ... The same thing when trying to contact Quinn. ... \"Maybe if we get to the temple, the jammers that Logan has set up will let our communication devices work again. ... \" Sam theorised, but he also knew that would mean more time without knowing what had happened to Peter. ... \"I'll go look for Peter. ... \" Vorden volunteered. ... \"I'm the least injured out of all of us, I can move quite fast, and I can even try to find him from above ground. ... Get Borden first and then just head to the Temple. ... If you have to, just go through it! ... \"It was important that the group didn't leave the Dragon on its own. ... After all, capturing him was the enemy's overall objective. ... With Eno having been sent flying and Brock having followed behind his master, Quinn was the only one there to look over it. ... However, after listening to Ray's warning, he suddenly had a new task, making Quinn struggle with what to do.'I know Ray said to get the tablet and I understand the importance of the tablet, but doesn't that mean, we have practically admitted defeat? ... They might be unable to take the Dragon immediately, but if we leave them to it, what if they succeed?' This was the reason why Quinn hadn't acted just yet. ... However, he didn't want to do just nothing and had decided to send Vorden and the others to help out the Cursed faction. ... Although Raten seemed to believe that as a humanoid Demon tier beast he was strong enough to match the Dragon, Quinn was convinced he wasn't. ... He might not know how strong Raten was in his current form, but he had fought against the Dragon previously, so he knew just how strong it was.'I know it's hard to admit defeat Quinn. ... We might not have seen the main perpetrator behind the attack, but you said it yourself. ... This fight is not worth sacrificing the lives of your friends over. ... At worst, just try to think of this as a backup plan that we are putting into action now.'Vincent's words had put his grandson's head on a little straighter, making his decision easier. ... The least he could do was obtain the tablet. ... Still, there was no doubt that the Dragon would try to stop him.'Since it's not a living thing I should be able to place it into my dimensional space, but it looks pretty rooted into the ground. ... I'll need to take it out somehow.' Quinn thought, wondering just how long that would take.'How do I get the Dragon to not attack me? ... What if I used Shadow lock on the dragon and moved it with us? ... If I use Shadow overload could I be able to take the Dragon away as well?'Quickly images of the Dragon breaking out of the Shadow lock and destroying everything on board the Cursed Ship appeared in Quinn's head. ... In the first place, he wasn't even sure Shadow lock would even work on a being so strong and large. ... Looking at his other options, Quinn's eyes landed on the Roseus tree. ... It was thanks to this that the Cursed faction and everyone had even been able to last so long. ... It was also why Quinn was aware of just how many the enemy numbered.'Maybe there's some way I can use the tree.'When using the Roseus tree, after most of the beasts had been defeated, Quinn had attempted to Mark the Masked that were attacking them as well. ... He could sprout and control its roots after all. ... However, all his attempts had ended in failure because he wasn't even able to get the chance to Mark them. ... The enemy attackers were on high alert, and it felt like it was almost impossible to grab hold of them. ... Even when Quinn had succeeded, for some reason marking them had required far longer than a beast. ... Whether it had something to do with their forms of intelligence or not, he didn't know. ... Either way, during the process the other Masked had attacked the roots, and Quinn had been able to feel some of his energy leak out from the cut parts. ... It also didn't feel like it would come back, at least not in a short while, hence why Quinn had stopped that experiment.'I'm starting to understand why the old Demon tier tree had spent years Marking people and beasts. ... It must have done so while people were asleep, or at the perfect moment while others weren't aware.'Still, perhaps Quinn could use the multiple roots, and the larger ones that were close to the main Roseus tree to his advantage. ... After all, Blade Island might be a place that none of them would return to again, so this might very well his last opportunity to use the tree.'I need something more, the Demon tier tree by itself won't be enough to slow it down.' Closing his eyes Quinn activated the amulet. ... His Dalki fighters had done well. ... Many of them were able to implement the martial arts skills that Quinn used, even with partial control. ... It was because of this they were able to do a better job than the other two spiked Dalki. ... However the numbers were overwhelming and eventually just like the Cursed members who had to retreat it was the same for the Dalki.'I can use their energy, but I know this won't be enough as well so there is only one thing I can do.' Quinn thought as he stood up and looked towards the tablet.'This is guaranteed to cost me MC cells, but there's no other choice, I'm afraid.''[Shadow Overload enhancement type soul weapon activated.] All of Quinn's shadows started to pour out of him and consumed him, giving him a shadow body. ... His shadows flicker with a slight purple glow, and stepping out, Quinn was ready to face the Dragon ahead. ... Stepping onto the open field, almost immediately the Dragon turned Quinn's way, and rather than staring at him for a few seconds like last time, it had already opened its maw to produce its giant orange flames. ... It looked like whatever effect Ray used to have on the Dragon was no longer in effect. ... Quinn swung both arms forward, creating a wall of shadows to block the flames, or make the flames stay in place. ... \"That's twice that someone blocked your fire attack. ... I guess you're not that scary of a lizard after all! ... \"Now that Quinn knew his shadow could stop the Dragon from hurting him, it was time he gave it everything he got. ... The Demon tier amulet around his chest started to glow.******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "At first Quinn had believed that he would have to drain the strength of the Dalki, but realising that his Shadow overload skill was enough to hold the Dragon, he decided to spare them. ... The Vampire Lord was sure he might need them later and instead of him directly lifting the tablet from the ground, there was a better person, or in this case being, for the job.'I only have a limited amount of time using Shadow overload, and I would like to use it for as little as possible otherwise my MC cells are going to take quite the hit.' Quinn thought, as he continued to block the flames coming from the Dragon's mouth. ... With both of them seeing that the flames weren't effective, Quinn knew what was going to happen next. ... Just as Vincent had watched it do in the fight against Eno, the Dragon turned its body, ready to use its gigantic tail, but Quinn was preparing his own thing as well.[Skill activated Shadow void]Shadow had been spreading across the ground far and wide ever since Quinn had activated his soul weapon, now that he had activated the skill, a large dome-like shadow covered both of them. ... Seeing the incoming tail, Quinn quickly sank into his shadows and appeared above the Dragon falling towards its back. ... The middle part of the tail hit nothing but air, yet the tip of it scratched the outside of the dome. ... To Quinn's surprise this left a hole in the dome, yet his shadows started to gather there, as if it was healing from a cut.'Looks like it really wants to get out of this place, but I'm right where I want to be.' Quinn took a glance at the tablet and tree that had also been trapped inside the dome. ... His current plan required him to buy time for the tree to follow his new command. ... He had to make sure the tree wouldn't be hit by any of the Dragon's attacks. ... It might have come from a Demon tier tree and Quinn knew that it had roots all over the island, yet he didn't want to gamble on how sturdy it was. ... Fortunately, the Dragon seemed to be fully focused on him. ... This was great for Quinn, since it meant the Demon tier beast had yet to notice the roots that had started to dig at the base of the tablet. ... As they sprouted from the ground around it, they used their tips like hands, trying to pull it from above, while pushing it from the ground underneath, yet neither method seemed to be working on first glance.'I can tell you're strong and I'm currently still too weak to defeat you.' Quinn thought. ... 'Which is why, I'll have to borrow your power again, so I can protect you!'His white gauntlet hand was placed onto the back of the Dragon and the active skill was activated once more. ... Power was quickly going into Quinn as the Dragon roared even louder in anger, doing his best to get rid of the pest on him. ... It was at that moment that Quinn felt something else. ... He had felt the connection to those he had turned fluctuate every so often, however this time one had been cut. ... The life of one of his companions had been lost, and once again he had not been there to prevent it. ... \"ARGHHH! ... \" Quinn screamed even harder, full of pain as the energy continued to spread into his body, while tears started falling down his face. ... An unknown distance away from where Quinn and the Dragon were, Eno had left the cave in the waterfall and had spotted someone he didn't think he would run into all the way out here. ... \"You're looking quite well for an old timer, but you don't have to be so loud. ... My ears are good enough to hear you even if you were to just whisper my name. ... \" Jim spoke to him in a casual tone. ... His choice of garments was that of a typical vampire, meaning he was mostly covered in black while also wearing a long trench coat. ... He looked to be in his thirties, yet his hair style was completely out of place for the current age, indicating his real age. ... Jim had grand sideburns that covered his sides, while his hair was overrun at the top with curls which were nevertheless neatly kept up for its shape. ... Richard was slightly surprised that the Dalki by Jim's side were merely one spikes. ... He would have thought that one of the masterminds behind this whole fight would have had better guards than that, at least three or four spikes. ... \"Your appearance hasn't changed.'' Richard noted, as he casually jumped from the rock he was on and landed on the land just by the river. ... The two of them now were a good ten meters away from each other, yet neither one had opened hostilities. ... Before Jim had been a Vampire knight working under his nephew Vincent, he had been the previous leader, which was why it was very strange for a vampire Jim's age to still have his young appearance. ... Realistically, he should have weakened by now. ... \"What have you done? ... ... ... have you really fallen that low? ... To use the lives of humans to extend your own? ... \" Richard asked in disbelief. ... Jim started to chuckle at his ancestor's reaction. ... \"And what if I have? ... Don't the vampires also use humans, even if they are mere clones for their blood supply. ... How have you not been able to face the simple reality that human lives are meant to be used by us? ... Aren't you wearing a set of Blood armour created from dead vampires? ... How are you any different from me in that regard? ... \"\"We are different from the beginning. ... \" Richard insisted. ... \"You only exist because of me! ... Jim, I did my best to try and sympathize with you, but I'm still unable to understand why you chose to go through with this madness! ... I understand that you've been wronged, that your accomplishments have always been diminished, but then shouldn't your anger be directed at the vampire settlement? ... Why are you helping the Dalki, no why are you trying to get rid of the humans? ... \"During their conversation, it sounded as if Richard was getting angry at points, only to quickly settle down soon after calming himself. ... Jim just smiled, yet this simple genuine gesture was all the more frightening. ... He seemed happy for the chance to talk with Richard as if he had been looking forward to it. ... \"Does it really look this way to you? ... Our side is the one who has united Humans, Vampires and even Dalki, all working together. ... Doesn't that sound like a perfect utopia to you? ... As for your question, don't worry, I'm going to teach the vampires their lesson soon enough. ... \"\"What do you think will happen when all the human's in existence are gone from this universe? ... Those vampires think that they are more important than humans, but don't realise that they are actually weaker. ... \"\"I don't just want to beat them, no I want to make them suffer. ... I will get rid of every drop of blood and I shall enjoy watching them starve until eventually they will realise that there is only one alternative left for them. ... \"\"The Dalki. ... \" Richard concluded. ... \"So your reason is so petty. ... Is it because the vampires rejected your idea, rejected you and the Dalki, that you are forcing them to come crawling to you for help?! ... How childish is that?! ... \"Richard didn't think he had gotten all the answers from Jim about why he was doing what he was doing, but this conversation had made one thing clear. ... Jim's mind was made up and there was no way of changing that. ... Since there was no way to get through to him by talking, Richard started to gather his hands together and the spire on the top of his head glowed. ... \"Come on, are you really going to attack me? ... \" Jim asked, letting out a sigh. ... \"As I recall, you still owe me a favour which I never got the chance to make use of. ... Don't you believe in fairness, equivalent exchange? ... Well, I would say now's the perfect time to call in that favour. ... \"\"It's rather simple, really. ... 'Don't get in my way'. ... Just let me pass and watch as I subdue the Demon tier beast. ... Otherwiseâ¦\"Jim placed his hand on the Dalki by his side. ... The back of the Dalki started to light up. ... A change was occurring as energy flowed through the creature. ... It was brief but for a second it looked like Richard could catch something that looked to be embedded in the palm of Jim's hand.'A crystal of some sort?'A few seconds later as the light faded, the Dalki's appearance had drastically changed. ... It had grown an entire foot larger, sprouted wings on it's back, its scale-like features had gotten more compact, and darker, and worse of all the number of spikes on its back had changed. ... In total there were six spikes present.******My Werewolf System has finally arrived on the Web Novel! ... You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Something that Quinn had to keep reminding himself as he went to face the Dragon, was that his goal in this fight wasn't to defeat it, just to buy time. ... It was a foreign feeling, when faced with a beast, but eventually it had gotten through to him. ... It was why he had opted to land on the giant beast's back, allowing him to hold onto its scales as it struggled. ... As a Vampire Lord his grip strength was enough to withstand the Dragon's efforts of shaking him off, yet given the hardness of its scales it was also almost impossible for Quinn to do the beast any real damage, but he didn't need to. ... All he needed to do was distract the beast while the tree did its job. ... Using this opportunity to his advantage and remembering what he had done to the Dragon before, Quinn wickedly used the active skill in his gauntlet. ... \"I couldn't protect someone again! ... \" Quinn screamed in anger as a power stronger than any he had felt before was entering his body. ... \"Someone died to protect your ungrateful scaly ass, you overgrown lizard!!!! ... \"The Dragon, feeling the strange sensation it had felt once before, started to flap its giant wings heading upwards. ... Quinn, still not having retracted the Shadow Void, understood what it was trying to do. ... He could tell that the dome wouldn't hold out based on the strength it had shown before, but there was something else he could do. ... With the Dragon lifting off, it had pushed through the dome destroying the upper shadow, revealing the blue sky above and the beast kept going up. ... Quinnn was finding it easier to hold on as he had more strength than before, and he could see that inch by inch the tablet had nearly come loose. ... Next, with one hand on the beast, Quinn started to form a giant shadow portal above. ... Right where the Dragon was to take flight, and as it rose, it had gone through it, only to find itself appearing right on the ground where it was once before. ... Quinn had activated his Shadow sink, and with his Shadow overload he was able to produce the shadows wherever he wished. ... No matter how often the Dragon tried to get him off, Quinn would make them return back to the ground.'It's working! ... I might not be strong enough to kill it, but at least I can make sure it doesn't go anywhere!' Quinn thought. ... After what felt like an eternity, Quinn could finally see that the Roseus tree had completed its task. ... A thirds of the large tablet had been stuck in the ground which was why it had taken so long for the tree to get it out. ... The energy drained from the Dragon was powerful but it seemed like the gauntlet had reached some sort of limit, no more energy was being passed onto Quinn. ... There was no use staying on the Dragon any longer. ... Running up to the top of his head, Quinn gathered the Qi in his legs and used his strength to push off from the Dragon to the ground where the tablet was. ... Soon, he started to form a Shadow on his back and from there two large black wings were formed, giving him a safe soft landing. ... [Dimensional space activate]A shadow appeared underneath the tablet, and it started to sink into Quinn's dimensional space. ... Allowing him to take it with him.'Thanks for the power boost.' Quinn gave him a grin, as he wiped away the tears. ... 'I hope you'll put up a good fight when they try to take you on.'Running out of the open area, Quinn deactivated his Shadow overload skill. ... He was ready for the backlash of using the skill, checking just how many of his MC points would be taken away. ... At the same time Quinn made sure to see what the Dragon would do next. ... As he neared the jungle, he saw the Dragon land directly on top of the Roseus tree, crushing it with its massive weight. ... Quinn immediately felt the energy escape from his Demon tier Amulet, and he was unable to control it in any way. ... Quinn was thankful that the tree had helped him out so much, and hoped this had at least been a quick death without much pain. ... He could have never imagined that one little seed would aid him to this degree. ... He didn't even want to imagine how much trouble he and the Cursed faction would have gone through without the Roseus tree.'With the tablet gone, will you remain in this place?' Quinn wondered. ... 'That's why you stayed on this island for so long, right? ... As long as you don't follow after me, you should enjoy your freedom for as long as you can.'[You must now pay your debt for using Shadow overload]Quinn knew this was coming. ... Each time he had used the Shadow overload skill, he had to pay the price for it afterward. ... The first time, Quinn had very little MC cells to use, so when using his soul weapon it had run out quickly fighting Cindy. ... It was later that he learned the more MC cells he had, the longer the Shadow Overload skill could last, which was why it hadn't run out even though he had been battling against the Dragon for a while. ... Quinn just knew that along with the increased time allowing him to use the soul weapon for, the cost had similarly increased. ... However, he had yet to figure out if the system calculated it based on the duration alone, or the quantity of shadows he used within that time.[-100 MC cells][10/1000 MC]Seeing this Quinn wasn't too shocked by the result. ... For one, although it had taken a large amount, Quinn still had a large number of MC cells left. ... What did surprise him, however, was how close he had been to having used up all his MC cells. ... It also looked like he had somewhat gotten his answear. ... That it was a mixture of time used, as well as the amount of shadow Quinn used while using the skill. ... If it had taken any longer his soul weapon would have deactivated. ... Right now, Quinn didn't even have the MC cells remaining to cast some of his Shadow skills. ... Thankfully, the Shadow link skill didn't require any to be used, and Quinn might not even need to use his Shadow powers in the first place, for he was filled with more energy than he could imagine from the Dragon.'Although the Shadow overload skill is strong, the more I use it, the further I feel like I am getting away from Arthur.' Quinn thought. ... While looking at his stats, Quinn kept an eye on what the Dragon was doing. ... It had walked around the place, even digging in places, apparently searching for the tablet which was now in his possession. ... Unable to find it, the Demon tier beast started to flap its wings.'Yes, get away from this place! ... As far as possible, just make sure the Dalki don't catch you!' Quinn thought, but he knew that perhaps they would eventually track it down again, and possibly before them. ... Thinking about this, Quinn wondered why Eno and Brock hadn't returned. ... They had been away far too long, they should have at least returned by now, and he also wondered how the Cursed faction were doing. ... Quinn would have to make a choice between returning to the others, or search for Eno. ... It didn't take him long to decide that with the Dragon about to take off, his priority was how the others were doing. ... The Dragon soon went up into the sky, and it looked like it was hovering around the island for a little longer as it was deciding what to do. ... Quinn wanted to keep an eye on it, but he soon heard the sound of footsteps. ... Turning his head, he could hear them coming from all sorts of different directions, His eyesight was able to keep up with them all, and he could see. ... From each direction there were groups, groups and groups of Masked.'What happened to my friends? ... Did those Masked manage to defeat them all?' Quinn worried, but other than the connection he felt go earlier, he couldn't feel anyone else in trouble at the moment. ... A red aura strike came towards Quinn, and moving his hand ever so slightly touching the aura with his finger tips it smashed on impact. ... The one who attacked Quinn, in seconds Quinn had moved and now had his hand gripped around his throat. ... \"You guys will all pay for this! ... \" Quinn declared, as a large shadow reached behind his back, and consumed the masked person he was holding. ... Seconds after the masked man started to scream widely.[Shadow eater skill successful][10 MC cells gained]The Dragon continued to hover over the island, roaring in anger, but it seemed to have suddenly realised that there was no longer any reason for it to stay, making it look towards the blue sky above. ... However, before it could appreciate its newfound freedom, it felt something slam down on its back. ... The force was so strong that the Dragon screamed in pain, as it plummeted down, shaking the entire island.******My Werewolf System has finally arrived on the Webnovel! ...

      "The group had made a decision, and with it, Vorden had gone off into the forest to search for Peter while the others headed towards the castle before they would make their way to the Temple on the island. ... Before leaving, Vorden had headed to where Raten was, informing him to come back and stay closer to the castle. ... It would be his job to make sure that no Masked got too close to the area for now. ... Inside the castle, the group had entered the room where Linda was present. ... They all could see her lying there peacefully on her bed, free from wounds, not even aware that she had visitors. ... Since her clothes had been tattered during the fight, Borden had dressed her in another setâ¦ a French maid outfit. ... Borden saw the strange eyes of the others looking at him, questioning his choice of attire. ... \"It was the only thing I could find in this place, I swear! ... \" Borden tried to explain himself, getting all red faced. ... \"She was out of it, and we had to leave her large Armour behind. ... We couldn't take it with us and until she wakes up, she can't use her Shadow equip to put on her regular armour and I couldn't just leave her half naked!!!. ... \"\"Don't try to explain yourself, bro. ... \" Fex said, placing his hand on Borden's shoulder. ... \"The more you try to explain yourself the guiltier you look. ... Besides, I think you made a good choice. ... \"There was another block head in the room who also appreciated the outfit, but even he knew better than to use this moment to make a crude joke about Borden's taste. ... Knowing that they needed to leave, and with no signs of Linda waking up, one of them would have to carry Linda along with them. ... Borden had quickly volunteered for the task, but for some reason the others didn't think it was a good idea for him to be carrying her, instead everyone agreed that Mona was a good choice. ... With her beast armour she had inhuman strength so it was no problem for her either. ... If necessary, Fex could use his string ability as well, allowing Mona to use her hands and legs while fighting. ... After picking up Linda's body, the group moved into the room next door, to find Wevil's corpse lying on a bed. ... The sheets underneath it had been stained red from the blood on his clothes. ... The feelings of the others in the room were filled with sadness, anger and even more. ... They all took a minute of silence to pay their respects to Wevil, before Fex eventually put the large wooden box that was on his back down. ... \"I won't let your body stay on this island, Wevil. ... \" Fex declared, carefully picking him up and gently putting him into the box which was fortunately quite well cushioned. ... After all, it had initially been designed to keep Agent 11 inside there even with Fex moving about widely. ... \"I'll make sure to protect you so that Linda gets to say her goodbye. ... I bet once we're back, Quinn will give you the best grave, allowing the rest of the Cursed faction to thank you for what you did for them. ... \" Fex spoke to the lifeless body. ... \"Can I help put the lid on? ... \" Layla asked. ... Naturally, Fex agreed to her request. ... Before he knew it, everyone was grabbing the lid of the box and helped close it, before carefully placing it on his back. ... \"I know it's hard for all of you, but remember we have to keep moving. ... \" Mona managed to say. ... As one of the former Big Four she lost enough subordinates and friends, but she knew that as strong as the members of the Cursed faction were, it didn't change their young age. ... It looked like they had been blessed, to not have to experience such a thing often enough to grow used to it. ... Unfortunately, as an outsider, she felt like it was her job to keep the group moving, so that Wevil would be the only casualty. ... After leaving the castle, the group was walking with Borden at the front. ... Not only because he was arguably the strongest among those present, but also because he knew the way to the Temple. ... As for Raten, as long as he didn't fight the Dragon he should be fine moving behind the others dealing with anyone that would follow as their rearguard. ... \"Th-that looks like it's the Dragon! ... \" Layla pointed upwards. ... The whole group turned as they could hear the Dragon's roar, and for the first time, it looked like it had left its place by the tablet.'I hope this means Quinn is okay.' Layla silently prayed for his well being. ... However, seconds later, a figure appeared just above where the Dragon was. ... Seeing it even from such a distance Mona instantly recognised it. ... After all, it was what had killed the Demon tier beast, her Kraken. ... Seconds later and the small figure had knocked down the Demon tier beast. ... The force of impact when it collided with the ground was so great that the next second they could all feel the entire island shake violently. ... The rumbling of the ground was so great it felt like an earthquake that was going to sweep them off their feet. ... \"WE HAVE TO GET OFF THE ISLAND NOW!!! ... \" Mona's hands were shaking, but she turned away from where the Dragon was, picking up her tempo, no longer caring whether the Cursed faction wanted to follow her or not, still carrying Linda along with her. ... Meanwhile, the Cursed group had trouble believing their own eyes, that there could actually be something out there that could so easily deal with the large Demon tier beast. ... \"Don't worry, maybe Quinn can't do stuff like that but he's stronger than any of us. ... \" Nate said in an attempt to cheer everyone up. ... However, the truth was that he honestly doubted any human or vampire would be able to pull off a feat like that.ââOut by the river, Eno was speechless after Jim had demonstrated he had the means to evolve a one spiked Dalki into a six spike in an instant.'A six spike and so fast? ... Was my information wrong? ... I thought the highest spiked Dalki of the leaders was a five spike, yet my eyes aren't deceiving me, I can clearly count six spikes at this moment.' Richard thought. ... It was at that moment, that the Dragon had been knocked out of the sky seconds later, making them all feel the aftermath. ... \"Just in case you thought they only looked the part, the one who took out that Dragon was another six spiked Dalki. ... Believe me, they're all the real thing. ... \" Jim said. ... \"That Blood armour of yours is impressive, I give you that, but are you really confident that it will be enough to take on a six spike that just did that to a Demon tier beast? ... \"\"It's true that the blood in my body is the same as in yours, hence why I'm giving you this chance. ... Let me turn in my favour now and the both of us can walk away from this freely. ... This is the last time I will ask, Richard. ... \"\"Which will it be, will you keep your wordâ¦ or will you pretend to have forgotten why you are standing in front of me at this very moment?! ... \"Richard knew exactly what Jim was referring to. ... \"While I believe in the principle of equivalent exchange, what you're asking me to do means forsaking the entire human race! ... I alone might not be able to deal with your Dalki, but you yourself should be easy enough! ... \" Eno shouted, as he lifted up both hands, and a red beam could be seen at the tip of both his fingers. ... The next moment, two Blood bullets shot out. ... Jim's face made it clear that he hadn't actually expected his ancestor to refuse. ... He had been unable to react, however the now six spiked Dalki by his side had, placing his hand out, blocking the bullet that had been aimed at Jim's head, yet the other went right through shoulder, causing him to moan in pain. ... \"Damnit, why didn't you block them both, you numbskull! ... \" Jim cursed. ... \"Screw it, just get that ungrateful old geezer! ... \"The Dalki's hand that had blocked the Blood bullet, one of the vampires' strongest offensive Blood spells, was completely fine. ... The next second, the Dalki jumped from its position throwing its fist out towards Eno. ... The red spire on the vampire's crown glowed, and just like when the Dragon had attacked with its flames, the Dalki only connected with an invisible pulse of red aura. ... It was similar to a wall while ripples of red aura were coming from where the Dalki had punched. ... \"That damned Blood armour. ... Eno, here I thought at least you could be reasoned with, but it seems like you're not the person I thought you were! ... I will take that armour for myself, and then take the king's armour as well! ... \" Jim roared in anger. ... It was at that moment, that another vampire leapt out from the jungle and swung its arm out towards Jim. ... \"Oh great, your lapdog has arrived! ... \" Jim shouted recognising that the person was Brock. ... Opening a small portal by his side, Jim pulled out a shield from the portal that looked to have been made from diamonds. ... The second Brock's arm touched the shield, it started to light up, and it felt like the power was being reflected right back towards him. ... His arm was breaking by the second, and the force seemed to be carrying on. ... Brock had no choice but to roll away from the ground, and now looking at his right arm, it was no longer where it was before. ... It had completely blown off. ... \"Hahha, you fool. ... Remember I am an Eno as well! ... Did you really think I would openly show all my cards? ... As you can see this was a little gift given to me, by your dear friend, Arthur. ... Vampires are so foolish, they have no idea just how powerful Demon tier equipment really is! ... \"\"I want you to remember one thing, Richard, it was you who refused my offer! ... \" Jim spat out, while placing his free hand on the other one spiked Dalki, whose body started to transform. ... Brock and Richard were now faced with two six spiked Dalki as well as the tenth family former leader who had a Demon tier shield in his hands.*****You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "For a while now, Quinn had remained on the same spot, fighting against hundreds and hundreds of Masked. ... However, he had yet to feel himself running out of energy. ... Using the power he had obtained from the dragon, he had managed to defeat each enemy with a single hit. ... It wasn't that the Masked had just stood there, waiting to take a beating, but their red aura powers had proven completely useless. ... If the Cursed faction had really wanted to, he could have taken them all out far quicker, however the reason why he hadn't done so was because he was being careful. ... In fact, he was careful to limit his damage to a point where he could use the Shadow eater skill, since this never ending mass of enemies proved to be a boon in disguise. ... Each one allowed him to gain 10 MC cells, which was great for his shadow ability and he had long since earned back the amount he had lost during his fight with the Dragon. ... 'Just getting more MC cells isn't going to make me stronger, but it will allow me to use the shadow ability in more ways. ... I also won't have to worry so much about using the Shadow Overload. ... I can feel that there are still more ways for me to use the Shadow Overload skill, but because of the drawback I couldn't really afford to play around with it for too long.'''If I continue getting rid of all these, I can learn how to fight better and this in turn will improve my strength and it won't just be a temporary boost like the Dragon's energy I have in my body right now!' Quinn thought, as he quickly grabbed the head of two Masked and slammed them to the ground. ... He used his Shadow eater skill on one, forming a strange blob like shadow consuming its body, and then did the same to the next one. ... [1360 MC cells in total][Congratulations][Shadow eater skill is now at level 2] 'Huh, so even the Shadow eater skill managed to evolve!' Quinn was surprised by this revelation, then again, he had never gone against this many vampires before, so he had been able to confirm if it was a skill he could even evolve from repetitive use.[The Shadow eater skill can now consume more shadow from each vampire it is used on. ... The Shadow eater skill's success chance has now increased. ... The Shadow eater skill is now able to form different shapes based on the user's will.]Reading through the changes, for a brief moment Quinn was happy. ... He had known that the Shadow eater skill's chance of success seemed to work based on how injured the vampires were that he used it against, yet there had still been cases when it had failed against a vampire who had been close to death. ... Quinn's happiness was short lived though, as he looked around and the number of Masked that were near the open area still hadn't decreased. ... 'Are they trying to get past me, and head to where the Dragon landed from earlier!' Quinn wondered. ... Once the island had shook, the vampires had suddenly stopped defeating Quinn and instead had attempted to run right past him. ... Rather than going after the Masked, Quinn decided to throw out his Shadow eater skill. ... Thinking back, Quinn remembered the strange shadow that had appeared when he saw Arthur use his skill. ... He wondered if this was a shape Arthur chose. ... Due to how far away the person was who he wanted to use the skill on, in Quinn's mind a certain bird formed. ... Now, leaving from his hand, the shadow eater's skill looked slightly different from before, going out in the shade of a small black raven. ... It also looked to be moving faster in this new form, and when it nearly reached the Masked, it opened its mouth wide, the shadow expanding far larger than the Masked person itself. ... A few seconds later and the Masked fell to the floor screaming in pain as it felt the suffering of being in the sun.[12 MC cells consumed]'That mask wasn't even injured and the shadow eater skill still worked, but it's still a little slower than hitting them myself.'Quinn felt a mask coming directly towards him, and this time, instead of wounding it, he had acted on instinct, using his full strength to pound it away. ... He threw an overhead punch, and his first landed straight in the mask cracking it. ... The mask broke off, and the vampire was no longer alive. ... 'Why, why even though I feel like I'm getting stronger, why do I not feel any better?' Quinn thought. ... He had hoped that fighting would keep his mind off things,, but in his current condition the Masked proved to be too easy an opponent. ... This left Quinn free to think about other things, mostly the fact that he didn't even know which one of his friends had died, and that once again he had failed to protect them. ... Not to mention, he felt responsible for bringing them all hereâ¦ 'Quinn wait, I think I saw something when you broke off that man's mask just now. ... Could you take the mask off of another one?' Vincent asked. ... Of course with the way Quinn was now, and even before it wasn't too much trouble, he easily grabbed the face of one of the Masked who was too weak to resist, and quickly ripped the mask off his face.'Alrightâ¦one more please.' Vincent asked. ... His tone seemed strange but Quinn knew Vincent would ask him to do that without any reason, which was why he didn't mind doing this one and continued to remove it from the next one as well. ... 'Thisâ¦ confirms it. ... They all look like Jim, they must be his clones.' Vincent clones. ... 'Jim? ... As in your old Vampire knight Jim? ... As in your uncle Jim who we suspect to be behind this whole mess? ... I knew that Eno could create clones, but how is it possible for Jim create this many?' Quinn asked, now also checking the faces of those he had defeated.'Our ability is a strong one Quinn, and honestly sometimes it is not just how great the mind can be as for the person with the ability, but also how far the person is willing to go. ... Look at your system. ... We have thought for a while now that it is able to do incredible things thanks to my ability, and even know it continues to grow. ... As for Jim, this is proof he has gone beyond.'Jimâ¦why did he need to go to such lengths? ... Quinn, if it's at all possible, please allow me to talk to him.' Vincent requested. ... ââBrock's severed arm had healed, blood was no longer falling down its side, however he now only had one good arm he could attack with, and seeing this, Jim was unable to hold in his laughter.'\"You are finished. ... \" Jim declared, and the next second the other six spiked Dalki who was on his side, had rushed over to where Brock was. ... Seeing this with his one good hand, Brock opened up the palm, and a large red ball of aura could be seen gathering. ... As the Dalki was running straight forward, Brock knew for sure that the attack would hit. ... Releasing the attack, Brock's arm lifted in the air, as the recoil was strong. ... What he had just successfully used was the attack known as the Blood cannon. ... A large red beam of aura had come out of Brock's hand and hit Dalki directly in the chest. ... The energy continued to hit the Dalki, until its whole body was absorbed by the red light. ... Eventually, the red aura ended. ... The Dalki could be seen standing there, having skidded across the ground a few feet back. ... \"For you to have managed to push a six spike Dalki all the way back here, the power of a former Royal Knight is indeed strong. ... Unfortunately for you, it still isn't enough to actually injure him! ... \" Jim taunted. ... Watching the whole thing from the side, was Richard, who was still using the power of the red aura blood armour to block the Dalki's attack. ... Since the first punch had failed, the Dalki tried again with another punch. ... No matter how often he repeated it, each time it would just hit the invisible wall of red aura, creating new ripples. ... 'These Dalki, are too much for Brock to handle, and that Shieldâ¦ we need to know what else it can do before we go against it.'Lifting up one hand, a portal appeared above where Eno was, and an object was seen dropping from the sky, now in his hand, he held a giant lance that was spinning as he held it. ... Even now as he did nothing it continued to give off a strange red glow. ... \"There are different ways for us to use our ability. ... For me, I used them to create the strongest item I could possible. ... \" Eno said, as he thrusted the lance forward, and the spire on his head was no longer glowing. ... The lance went straight for the Dalki that saw its chance to attack him. ... The Dalki, with its new found power decided to try grab the lance, but as soon as it did, it felt its skin ripping from its hard scales on its hands. ... Feeling its power, for the first time the Dalki stepped back, looked at the green blood on its hands and noticed that the person responsible hadn't moved forward. ... \"You are weaker than I thought. ... \" The Dalki growled, having gained more energy from its injury. ... The look on Eno's face spoke volumes. ... With that attack, he had expected to kill the Dalki or at the very least heavily injure it, yet it had done little more than give it surface wounds. ... Although Eno was safe due to his blood armour, Brock was not, and it looked like there was nothing he could do. ... The six spiked dalki that was facing Brock, charged in again. ... When it was a few meters away from him, it saw something flash in front of It, and lifted up its arms. ... A clang was heard as the object hit the Dalki's arms, and to its surprise, now it's forearms had been cut, making it bleed. ... \"How? ... What could cause a six spiked Dalki to end up like that. ... Fair enough Eno's weapon but there should be no one else strong enough. ... \" Jim said. ... It was then that they could see a pair of legs and a tail in front of Brock, with a headless man behind him. ... \"So this was where all the action was going on. ... \" Peter said, appearing by Brock's side.\n",

      "After having had to fight off waves of Masked during the start of their attack, now it felt bizzare not encountering any. ... The lack of enemies didn't ease their minds, if anything it made them be on edge even more. ... There were two possibilities the Cursed group had come up with as to why this was the case. ... One of them was that the Masked were no longer interested in them, most likely busy trying to subdue the Demon tier beast now that it was back on the ground. ... After all, that had always been their primary goal. ... The second theory was that Raten was simply doing a far better job than any of them had expected, so well that not a single Masked had managed to get past him. ... Whichever it was, it had allowed them to reach the Temple in a reasonable amount of time. ... There were no beasts nor any Masked outside, only a small person standing there to greet them. ... \"I expected that you would come eventually. ... It sounds like things have gotten rough out there. ... \" Logan said, leading the way inside. ... The group noticed the turrets he had set up, as he showed them where the teleporter was. ... \"There have been no signs of the enemy coming this way. ... Most likely because the Temple is too far away from where the Demon tier and the tablet were. ... Their group seems to be focusing only on their goal, which made my job easier. ... \"\"Why haven't you turned on the teleporter, Green? ... \" Mona asked Logan. ... \"That six spiked Dalki that took out my Kraken has managed to knock down the Dragon. ... After they're done, they'll most likely come after us and I doubt they'll be interested in capturing us. ... We shouldn't waste any more time and should be getting out of here! ... \"\"It's on standby to avoid risking the enemy picking up anything to locate it. ... Besides, I can see that not everyone is present. ... First we should discuss what to do. ... I can't risk anyone panicking, going through, and destroying the teleporter on the other side, that would be disastrous for all of us still on the island. ... \" Logan explained. ... \"What do you mean? ... \" Agent 11 questioned. ... \"I thought we came here for all of us to just go through the teleporter? ... That other beast said he was getting one of you guys to bring him here, so what's the problem? ... \"It at least seemed like Mona and Agent 11 were on the same wavelength, but as for the rest of themâ¦ they looked at each other and it seemed like they all had already made up their mind. ... Layla stood forward as if she was to speak for the others. ... \"Quinn's Shadow ability might allow him to return to the Cursed faction at any point and time, and I honestly couldn't care less about Eno and his servant, but I still worry about Vorden and Peter. ... There's a chance that they might not be able to meet with Quinn, this could be the only way for them back. ... \"\"I will be staying here, protecting this place until the two of them return. ... We've already lost one person in our group. ... I don't want to lose anymore. ... \"The others just nodded along with what Layla had said, they were going to stay on the island and protect the teleporter until their friends would return, so they could escape together. ... \"So does that mean we all stay here? ... \" Logan asked. ... Agent 11 raised his hand, but as quick as he did, Fex gave him a nudge. ... \"You don't get a say in this, as my puppet you'll have to come everywhere I go. ... \"\"I can't stay, guys. ... \" Mona shook her head. ... \"I understand that you all care for each other, and truly I envy you for your camaraderie, but I didn't come here because of a higher calling. ... I came to repay a favour and I feel like I have done more than enough. ... \"\"I have cheated death twice already, so I don't wish to push my luck any further. ... Once they capture that Dragon, and believe me they will, it wouldn't surprise me if they destroy this island outright. ... If you're lucky they might come looking for us before that though. ... \"\"They shouldn't know anything about this teleportation yet, so they'll assume we're on the island. ... Your people might be here, but I have people waiting for me too. ... \"The others agreed that it was unfair for them to ask Mona to stay. ... However, she was a strong ally for the group. ... Her staying behind would increase their chances of survival, but nobody felt it fair to ask that much of her. ... \"Can you at least take them? ... \" Sam asked. ... \"Please, take them back to the Cursed ship. ... Inform Megan and she will know what to do. ... \"Mona looked at the large box that had Wevil's body inside, and Linda who had been placed on a few cushions that had been found in the room. ... \"It will be my pleasure. ... \" Mona replied. ... \"I will leave Snakey and the Gorilla to the both of you to help out as much as possible. ... They seem to have grown a liking to your group. ... If possible, bring them back. ... \"When the Roseus tree had been destroyed the Marking had naturally disappeared from the Gorilla, but due to how helpful it had been, Mona had decided to tame the beast with her ability and now it would follow any command or order she gave it. ... Keeping to her promise, she strapped the large crate on her back, while holding Linda in her arms. ... The teleporter had been turned on and was set for the Cursed ship. ... Just before Mona was to step in she turned around to the group. ... \"Good luck to you allâ¦ make sure to come back alive! ... I'll treat you to something nice after this is all over. ... \"With the rest having agreed to stay, everyone had decided to split up, to cover certain areas of the Temple. ... They mostly stayed on top of the roofs where the turrets had been set up. ... Sam and Logan remained in the teleporter room discussing what they had seen on the island, and everything said so far. ... \"I see, so it looks like they will successfully take the Dragon after all. ... \" Logan said. ... \"It must be hard on everybody. ... They fought so hard, and we even lost Wevil. ... It will feel like they just wasted their time since there was no result. ... \"\"There is one thing that we have learned about the enemy, though. ... \" Sam replied, trying to look for some silver lining in the whole event. ... \"We know that there are six spike Dalki's capable of destroying Demon tier beasts, and that's most likely what they will be using to take care of the Dragon as well. ... On top of that all the vampire clones. ... \"When Sam said this out loud, Logan didn't say anything either, because they both knew, although they now possessed this information, they had no clue how it was going to help them. ... If anything it just made them realise how hopeless the situation was for humanity. ... \"What do you thin-\"\"Don't ask a question you don't want the answer to. ... \" Logan cut Sam off before he could ask. ... \"Let me point out something that will give everyone hope. ... There is still a chance of us winning this thing. ... Even if they successfully get the Dragon, there is still one thing we can do to win the war. ... \" Logan stressed. ... As to what that was, Sam had an idea but how likely would that happen. ... Layla and Nate were both at the south gate of the Temple. ... This was the main entrance with an open pathway in front of the Temple. ... All the other sides were mostly blocked by the heavy jungle. ... Nate had decided to meditate, hoping to recover as much of his Qi as possible. ... Layla acted as the lookout and spotted ruffling of trees in the distance and quickly drew her bow, ready to attack. ... When she finally saw who was coming out of the forest she put her bow back down, as a man drenched in blood from head to toe was seen, and he had a smile on his face. ... Both of them seeing this, there was a shiver that had been sent down their spine, they were just happy that this one is on their side. ... \"I would put that bow back up if I were you. ... \" Raten called out, as he turned around again, acting like a gatekeeper. ... \"They're coming for this place. ... \"****** You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Truth be told, Brock had no idea if he was going to survive the incoming attack from the six spiked Dalki. ... After it had survived his Blood attack he knew its hard skin was resilient, but he still had no idea about its own attack power. ... Yet, the last person he would have ever suspected to arrive and stop the Dalki's advance, was the Wight. ... \"Damn, that's the first Dalki I've seen that hasn't been cut in half from Legs' attack. ... \" Peter noted as he stood there with two tonfa's out by his side. ... He was trying to observe the situation, and could see one six spiked fighting the old scientist, and another directly in front of him with another man behind. ... \"That tailâ¦ is that Slicer's body! ... What have you done to it?! ... \" Jim seemed shocked, yet he seemed less fazed about having to fight her remains and more amazed by the sheer ingenuity at what he was seeing. ... \"Here I was wondering just how strong my little pets actually are. ... Thanks to you, I'll finally be able to test out their power compared to a genuine five spiked Dalkiâ¦ or at least close enough to one! ... \" Jim commented, having conjured a small little notebook and a pencil from a portal, while the six spike was on the move again. ... Headless Hilston was the first one to make a move. ... The Lesser Wight looked different compared to before as his body was now equipped with a set of beast armour. ... It dug its fingers into the ground, and lifted part of it, chucking it forward. ... The Dalki didn't even attempt to evade the piece of land that was coming its way and just ran through it, but right after crashing through the debris, Legs was there with its giant tail, thrusting it forward aiming right for the six spiked Dalki's head. ... It moved so fast that the Dalki was unable to do anything about the tip of the tail piercing its left eye. ... However, before Legs could dig in any deeper the Dalki had grabbed onto its extremity. ... It was ready to make its opponent pay for damaging its eye, but there were already three people surrounding it to back Legs up. ... Headless Hilston, Peter, and Brock were all underneath the creature and with all their strength they all went to attack the same area. ... The elbow of the Dalki. ... Although they were unable to do anything on their own, together they could attempt to do something. ... Their great strength put massive amounts of pressure on the joint, causing the elbow to bend inward slightly, yet it wasn't enough for the Dalki to let go. ... That moment Legs used the Dalki's strong grip to her own advantage, pulling herself in with the strong muscles of her tail and spinning her body towards the Dalki delivering a kick to the same jointâ¦ leading to a loud crack. ... Pain shot through the Dalki's body enough to let go of the tail as it screamed out in pain. ... The others took that as their chance to retreat back to their original position, thinking about their next move. ... They were also prepared for the Dalki to move at any second once again.'For a Wight to possess this level of intelligence... ... Usually their kind would just attack their target in a frontal and often suicidal manner, completely relying on their regeneration, but this boy waited long enough to see where I would attack first and then decided to attack the same place.' Brock noticed. ... 'It looks like he realises that I have a better head on my shoulders, and that Tail is special.''Perhaps, there is something different about the six spikes that are created using Jim's power, and the five spikes that the Cursed faction had managed to defeat on their own. ... Slicer's tail seems to be a trait that not all of the Dalki are able to obtain, not even the six spikes have something like it. ... It also can move faster than the six spikes and is capable of cutting through their hard scales.''Unfortunately, even with the power of all of us, we were unable to do much.'Sure, the four of them together had managed to cause a few scratches on the Dalki's forearm, even breaking its elbow, but all of it was futile if they couldn't kill it. ... After a few seconds of both sides staring at each other, the Dalki was able to heal the broken elbow, and with it having been hurt more, most likely it was now even stronger than before.'The worst thing is, we still haven't been able to witness its true strength, and I really don't want to after seeing one of them hit the Dragon to the ground like that.'It was all these thoughts that had caused Brock to come to a decision. ... The way Peter currently was, he would be a huge asset to the future. ... With his ability, and with his current Lesser Wights he was someone he had to be protected at all costs. ... \"Thank you for saving me, but I'm afraid this doesn't look like a fight we're going to win. ... \" Brock sighed. ... \"You are still valuable to the Cursed faction and Quinn, which is why I can't let you stay here. ... Get out of here while you still can and take the other two with you. ... Find Quinn and find some way to get you and all of the Cursed faction off this island! ... \"The Wight heard what Brock had said, and honestly he wasn't too keen to sacrifice his life for the two of them, but were they really in that tough of a situation? ... It was hard for Peter to believe. ... With him and his Lesser Wights they should be able to hold on, at least long enough for Quinn to arrive. ... With him there surely they should somehow be able to do something? ... \"The lapdog actually has a point. ... Until now I have mostly ignored the Cursed faction, because I didn't believe for your little group of friends to make much of a difference. ... The loss of Slicer was already a very unexpected surprise and seeing one of you being able to revive her, I can't just let you leave! ... \" Jim held up the shield and strangely the six spiked Dalki that had been facing towards them this whole time had turned around and pulled back its armâ¦ aiming at Jim! ... The next second, they saw the Dalki seemingly use its full power to throw out a devastating punch and Jim made sure to use both his hands to hold the shield up. ... The punch landed but nothing happened. ... The shield hadn't lit up like it did when Brock had punched it, nor had Jim been sent flying through the air. ... It looked similar to what would have happened if a child was to punch a wall. ... \"With this, your fate is sealed. ... \" Jim stated with a smile, holding up the shield and it soon started to glow just as before. ... \"PETER MOVE! ... GET OUT OF HERE NOW! ... \" Brock shouted as he grabbed him by the scruff of his shirt and chucked him back into the jungle. ... The two Lesser Wights followed behind to catch their master and by the time Brock turned around, he was faced with the full brunt of an explosive energy. ... The energy from the shield was already leaving a great blue light. ... As it left the shield and touched the stones on the floor they flew behind Brock like bullets shot from a pistol, piercing through many trees in the jungle. ... The energy continued to go forward and Brock was sure that he wouldn't survive this.'That shield, it can either store the energy from attacks inside it and use it against, or it's something much worse. ... When I attacked it myself, I felt that the energy coming off from the shield was at least two times stronger than my initial attack. ... If that's right, then right now, that shield is emptying a strike twice as strong as a six spiked Dalki.'Somewhat accepting what his fate was to be, Brock was ready to close his eyes. ... Peter had turned around for a second, and seeing the impact the strange blue light had made so far, he continued to run forward with Legs and Hilston behind him. ... Before Brock had fully closed his eyes, he saw another figure in front of him. ... \"As you said Brock, me and you will figure out some way to deal with this. ... It was a good decision you made. ... \" Richard said as the red ripples activated form his armour blocking the strange energy of the attack. ... However, the attack seemed to be larger than the area that the red ripples could cover. ... Larger than the breath of the Demon tier dragon beast, it went around the red ripples. ... As it touched the trees they were uprooted from the ground, and flung through the air. ... Giant rocks had been turned to rubble, and. ... Small little hill that stood not too far from where they were had been blasted with parts of the rock falling into the sea. ... Eventually, the attack had ended, and Jim had moved his shield. ... His eyebrows were furrowed and his forehead full of wrinkles in anger seeing that Richard had managed to get in his way once again, but behind him, the whole jungle had been cleared. ... The once lush vegetation was nothing but a soil of wasteland now, while part of the hill looked to be missing as well. ... \"Why do you all struggle so much? ... How can you not understand that you have no chance against me? ... This much was all from a single punch of one Dalki? ... \" Jim questioned one, shaking his head. ... Richard, serving the attack with Brock behind him, looked into the direction he just was. ... \"I understand very well. ... Your six spiked Dalki are indeed strong, but for one there is nothing that can get through this armour, and as for the second point. ... When using our ability there is always an exchange and I seem to have figured out just what price you have made them pay. ... \"Over to the side where Richard was fighting not too long ago, the six spiked Dalki laid on the floor dead. ... However, strangely, other than its cut hands, it looked to have no visible wounds on its body, but it was clearly no longer moving.******You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",

      "Finally, after what seemed like endless fighting to Quinn, he could tell that the Masked were starting to settle down. ... More so, he also noticed that none of the other Cursed faction members seemed to be in trouble. ... For now at least, which was why Quinn was able to continue thinning their numbers while strengthening himself. ... He checked his status which now displayed.[2643 MC cells]'Fighting all of these Masked hasn't been too bad for me. ... Not only was I able to increase my maximum MC cells, but also recover some of my MC points so I can use my shadows to fight again. ... After gaining some of my MC points back, using the dome to speed up my recovery and fight the rest of them was a good idea.' Quinn thought to himself. ... After learning that those Masked were merely clones of Jim, Quinn felt a lot more at ease killing them, and during his little massacre he had also discovered a few other things about the Masked. ... For one, none of the Masked seemed to have a blood crystal inside of them, despite them clearly being vampires. ... Quinn had asked Vincent about this, but unfortunately the other had never been able to successfully clone one, so he lacked the necessary knowledge to be able to answer him. ... Nevertheless, that didn't stop the Masked from using their Blood powers, so the best explanation Vincent had on that matter was that it might have been one of the drawbacks of the clones, potentially even the very reason why clones didn't really enjoy a long life expectancy. ... Regardless of this, Quinn was happy to use the clones to increase his MC cells, allowing him to block stronger attacks with his shadow, gain more shadows to fight with and lastly use the Shadow Overload skill for a longer period of time. ... It was then, when the Masked that had surrounded Quinn were down to the last thirty, that they had stopped engaging him, rather they remained on their place. ... This approach made it seem as if they were buying time for something. ... It was at that moment, once again Quinn could feel the ground slightly vibrating. ... His ears were the first to catch the loud noise and the next second he could see a large beam of blue light off in the distance. ... When the Dragon had been attacked it had come from behind Quinn, yet this new attack had come from his front, which was why the Cursed faction leader was heading there.'Damn it, it looks like I might have wasted too much time on you guys!' Quinn thought, no longer caring about using the Shadow eater to improve his MC cells marginally and instead went to finish them all off quickly instead. ... And then finally there was only one. ... This one felt different to the rest of the Masked, as he was shaking and Quinn had left this one on its own on purpose. ... Quinn took a step forward, and immediately hit both of the hands that had been raised in order to defend the masked man. ... \"I knew from the beginning of the fight that you were different. ... I'm surprised you didn't run away until this point. ... \" Quinn said as he lifted his hand pulling the mask off from the person's face and threw it on the floor, quickly stomping on it breaking it to pieces. ... The person behind the mask had tears already running down their face, and for once it wasn't Jim's face that greeted him like all of those others he had unmasked. ... \"Please don't kill me, we were forced to come here, We were told to fight! ... Otherwise if we didn't we would be killed! ... \" It looked like a fairly young man, older than Quinn himself in his late twenties. ... Seeing this, there was something bothering him, why would the humans be working with Jim in the first place. ... \"Tell me who you are. ... What do you know about the person you are working for and why are you here? ... \" Quinn asked, since the person already seemed to be willing to speak, Quinn didn't feel the need to use the Influence skill at all. ... Especially since he was pressed for time. ... Often, the influence skill would be more direct with extracting information from one, causing Quinn to ask multiple questions. ... \"T-truedream! ... Y-you must have heard of our family name before, right? ... \" The man stuttered slightly in fear. ... \"No I'm sure you have, we, the humans, all of us here are those that used to belong to the Truedream family! ... \"Hearing this, Quinn was so surprised that he almost dropped the person to the ground, but another voice soon snapped him out of it. ... \"What did you say? ... \" Vorden asked from behind. ... \"I thought the Blades were the ones that had gotten rid of the Truedream family? ... Didn't they retaliate after attacking? ... \"Quinn still hadn't yet recovered from the shock of the news, as he saw Vorden here but at the same time he too was interested in what the person had to say. ... \"It's true, we were attacked by the Blade family. ... However, a few of us had managed to escape back to Dreamland city, but what surprised Trudream, and the rest of us, was that while we were away another group had attacked us as well, they captured Jack and the rest of us. ... \"Quinn had a feeling that Truedream was still alive, but for him to also be working for the other side was not what he had expected, just what Jim was planning to do with him. ... It was then while in the middle of these thoughts, Quinn had also ran into Peter, and his two Lesser Wights, from the part of the jungle that was still left. ... \"Whoa, I mean I thought I had killed a lot, but Quinn what did you do? ... \" Peter asked as he went through a field full of dead bodies. ... Quinn didn't really know what to do with the person from Truedream but thought that they could perhaps get more answers from him about Jim, and maybe more details about where they were or what they were planning. ... In the meantime, the rest had told Quinn what they needed, Vorden had informed him of what the rest of the Cursed faction were doing, and Peter had updated what was happening with Eno and Richard. ... \"A six spiked Dalki? ... \" Quinn questioned, having trouble believing it. ... He clenched his fist, trying to think about what he could do against one, if he had already been powerless in front of Slicer without the help of the Blades. ... How would he fare against the six spike? ... \"Quinn, I think it's obvious that we won't be able to fight them on our own. ... With that kind of power they might really succeed in taking the Dragon. ... There's no point in us staying here, so let's head back and regroup at the Cursed faction ship. ... Maybe we can figure out something else. ... Hunt more Demon tier beasts, get better equipment and fight them later. ... \" Vorden suggested. ... Honestly, Vorden when coming here didn't think he needed to do much convincing to the two of them, he thought it was clear that this whole mission had been one giant failure, but there was a certain look in Quinn's eye that said he wasn't planning to go back.'Quinn, I don't like asking you for so many favours, but I think there might be something I can do. ... Take me to Jim, let me speak to him.' Vincent requested. ... After thinking about it for a while, and with the little push from Vincent, Quinn had made his decision. ... \"I think there is still something I can doâ¦ no, that I have to do. ... Don't worry about me, with the Shadow ability, I can travel to one of you even without the teleporter. ... Take Peter and this guy with you, I believe he might have some more information for us. ... \"The man looked like he was about to complain, but then staring at the dead bodies on the field, he quickly shut his mouth, realising that he was still lucky to be alive. ... Who cared who he used to work for, he just wanted to live. ... \"Don't worry, I'm not going to risk my life for Eno. ... You all know how much I dislike him, but if I can bring him back with us.... ... I still think he might be able to help us with Arthur as well. ... And... ... They have dealt a big blow to us, while we still haven't dealt a big blow to them. ... I can't just leave them like that. ... \"The two of them understood, and it looked like they also wanted to stay with Quinn, that was until Quinn could feel a connection inside him once again. ... \"The others, they're under attack! ... \" Quinn called out. ... \"The rest of the Masked must be attacking the guys at the temple. ... Please hurry up, they will need your help! ... Head back to the Cursed ship, it's an order! ... \"The two of them looked at Quinn for a few seconds, before they started to head off in the other direction. ... \"Vorden!' Quinn shouted out, just before he fully left. ... \"Who was it? ... \"From just this much, Vorden knew what Quinn wanted to know. ... \"... ... It was Wevil. ... \"\"I will make them pay for taking his life! ... \"*****You will get access to the MVS + MWS webtoon for only $3 dollar a month.\n",
