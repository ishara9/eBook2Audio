      "... \n",
      "When leaving the Parasites to their own devices, there was the chance that they could use this time to run away. ... To escape the planet, however, where would they even go? ... Who would they run off to? ... Wevil, had promised Quinn that he would follow him from now onwards, and to leave everything to him and Hana. ... Even though Tony was the vice leader, the faction members actually had the most respect for these two. ... Whenever something had gone wrong, they would be the ones that tried to reason with Mantis, to give them part of the antidote earlier than needed. ... While Tony would be the one who was Mantis's yes men. ... Saying Yes to every suggestion and everything he did. ... \"Alright everyone, it's time for you all to decide! ... \" Wevil shouted from on top of the platform. ... The faction members were recovering and they had gained enough strength to move again. ... But they were unaware of the bombshell that Wevil was about to drop on them all. ... \"You have a choice√¢¬Ä¬¶. ... \"*****Heading back, Quinn and Sil had no trouble and they had arrived at the shelter sooner than they thought. ... A message had been sent back ahead of time, and Peter had responded saying that Dennis was acting strangely, but that was a while ago. ... The two of them went through the teleporter and were onboard the Cursed ship, running straight for the command centre, but before they could even reach there. ... Peter was standing in the main large open hall. ... \"Quinn, did you manage to solve it? ... \" Peter asked. ... \"I didn't, but Sil can now remove the poison. ... Where are the others? ... \" Quinn asked. ... Peter led the way but didn't say much, he didn't know what to say to Quinn to prepare him for what had happened while he was on his way. ... If anything Quinn seemed to be in a happy mood that he had actually found a way to save the others. ... Then entering the training room, Quinn could see many people in the room. ... It reeked of blood, but he expected this. ... As time went on, he imagined more of them were throwing up on the ground like the others. ... Sam was present, along with Paul and Kazz. ... The two of them were standing over Dennis, Nate and Fex. ... They looked like they had been beaten a few times, but were at least still alive. ... Sil seeing them rushed over quickly and got to work removing the poison. ... Scanning the room more, he saw Linda, away from them all. ... She was sitting down on the floor with her head on her knees. ... Quinn had seen Sil do this a number of times when he was upset. ... However, what caught his attention more than that, was two things. ... First, the sound of crying coming from Linda, she was uncontrollably sobbing and even now tears were falling to the floor. ... The second thing was what was in front of her. ... A sheet had been placed over something and right at the bottom, a pair of boots could be seen sticking out from them. ... \"No, no I brought back Sil, we can get rid of the poison,\" Quinn said walking towards her. ... Seeing Linda, and the body in front of her, it didn't take long for him to put the two things together. ... When she heard someone coming closer, she looked up to see Quinn through her blurry vision. ... \"Quinn√¢¬Ä¬¶\" She cried. ... \"Blip, you can save him√¢¬Ä¬¶ Right? ... Please tell me you can save him! ... \" She continued to sob. ... It was her last hope, hoping that Kazz was wrong about what she had said. ... Kneeling down on his knees, Quinn removed the sheet to have a look underneath it, a bloody mess known as Blip. ... He closed his eyes and placed the sheet back over. ... He knew Blip was dead. ... \"I'm sorry√¢¬Ä¬¶ I'm sorry I wasn't here, I can't bring back the dead. ... \" Quinn said softly. ... Placing her head back down, she continued to sob, Quinn went to approach her, hoping to perhaps comfort her. ... \"Don't, please Quinn, just go away. ... I know it's not your fault, or Fex's but I just can't look at you right now, not for a while. ... \" Linda said. ... Quinn understood and decided to leave her be. ... She was such a strong woman and it broke his heart to see her like this, but then he was starting to wonder what happened? ... Blip wasn't infected by the poison in the first place. ... Thinking back at the image of Blip in his mind, there was something he could see on the neck. ... It was two bite marks. ... Immediately, Quinn's mind wanted to blame Kazz, and walking back towards them a strange energy was overflowing from him. ... He had enough, if Kazz was behind this, then he was unsure if he could hold himself back this time, even his gauntlets were already covered in a strange shadow. ... \"Quinn, it wasn't Kazz,\" Paul said, knowing the look in his eyes. ... Hearing this, he started to think about what Linda had said, about how she said she didn't blame him or 'Fex' for this. ... The anger started to calm down, and the shadow disappeared. ... \"But how? ... \"Everything was explained to Quinn about what had happened while they were away. ... He was kicking himself in the foot wondering, if he had stayed behind, if the outcome would have been different. ... However, Sam, Nate and Dennis all tried their best to comfort him, especially Dennis who was more thankful than even before to Quinn. ... He knew that his life was hanging on the line, and if Quin hadn't left to deal with the Parasites as quickly as he did, there was a good chance that he could be dead as well. ... Eventually, the news was released to everyone on the Cursed ship. ... A day of mourning had been given to Blip. ... It came as a shock, especially since a lot of members of the Crows had joined because of him. ... What surprised everyone even more, was Linda had yet to be seen at the morning event. ... They were expecting some type of speech from her, but nothing had occurred. ... Blip's death was blamed on the Parasites, and with that, the news of Quinn attacking them was also spread. ... They weren't informed of how he did so alone, but they couldn't have imagined a large group having acted. ... Otherwise, more faction members would have known about it. ... To them, the order of events were jumbled. ... They had thought Blip had been killed by the Parasites some ways and then Quinn went to deal with them, which just proved to all of them how much Quinn cared about their lives. ... He thought that maybe people would leave after such a thing, but they had all decided to stay. ... Showing him more respect compared to before. ... Wevil had kept to his promise. ... He was unable to get in contact with Daisy, as they were dealing with their own things, but he left them a message blaming the event on the Parasites. ... They decided to stick to the story that was spread around the Cursed faction. ... After the duel, Mantis had attacked Blip, and Quinn retaliated. ... Most of the Parasite members agreed to join under the Cursed faction, they were very thankful after the poison was removed like Wevil thought they would be. ... The members explained the situation to their families as they were unaware of what was really going on in the Parasites. ... The shelter they had could remain and now was in the process of being built permanently. ... They wanted a person to oversee this matter, and in the end, Linda was the one who volunteered. ... She had recovered a little from her brother's death, trying to act normal with everyone, but there was an odd feeling around her whenever they would converse. ... When she volunteered it came as a surprise, and they thought it might be best to give her a task like so, to get her mind off it. ... When going through the Parasite's belongings, they found that Mantis had written his own personal Poison ability book. ... It was given to Paul to look over and he had found that it had cultivation techniques that would teach someone to get their ability up to level eight. ... It was the thing he needed most right now. ... It was a tough time for the Cursed faction, but Paul reminded them that many more tough times were probably to come in the future, even though big things were happening they couldn't just take a break. ... They needed to proceed with their plan. ... The plan that would place them in prime position to become part of the big three. ... A powerhouse of the human race. ... In those two days, wiping the sweat from his head, Alex looked at the last piece of equipment on his table.'Finally the emperor tier equipment.. ... is done.'****For MVS artwork and updates follow on Instagram and Facebook: jksmanga\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 148] Preparing: Chapter 847: Who am I? ... 'How long have I been here?' He wondered. ... His head had been ringing with pain upon waking up. ... It had been dull but constant, without any signs of stopping anytime soon. ... No matter how hard he tried to think about how he got into his current situation, he was unable to remember a single thing from before he woke up. ... Fighting through the ringing pain he had eventually managed to open his eyes. ... At first he had seen absolutely nothing. ... His eyes needed time to adjust to their surroundings. ... His vision was slightly altered which could only mean only one thing. ... Right now he was in a complete pitch black room. ... It took quite a bit of time before he started being able to make out the silhouettes of the things around him. ... Still it was a far cry from him being able to see during the day. ... 'Where exactly am I? ... How did I get here?'As the ringing suddenly started to dull, he attempted to move his hands. ... Unfortunately he quickly realised that they were heavier than they should be. ... His attempt resulted in the sound of metal scraping across the floor. ... Moving the other hand and his legs resulted in the same thing happening. ... He was completely chained up. ... \"Arghhh! ... \" He shouted with a hoarse voice, using his mighty strength to pull against the chains, but to no avail. ... He could only move each of his extremities up to ten centimeters before his freedom got restricted.'At least that annoying ringing in my head has stopped.' After having this thought, he suddenly had another shocking realisation.'My name√¢¬Ä¬¶ What was my name?! ... Why can't I remember something as simple as my name?!'Then he started shouting in frustration for whoever put him here to come forward. ... Unsurprisingly there wasn't anyone who came forward. ... Frustrated he wanted to touch his head, but once again the chains stopped him from doing so. ... Once he noticed that he had forgotten his name, he tried to remember other things about him√¢¬Ä¬¶ only to realise that he was drawing more and more blanks. ... He was unable to recall his name, his age, his outer appearance or anything about his past. ... It was as if his life had just begun a few moments ago when he had opened his eyes. ... His heart started beating louder and louder as he started to panic, and the walls appeared to start closing in on him from his perspective. ... \"Arghhhh! ... \" He shouted again, stomping his foot on the floor so hard that part of the ground had risen. ... \"It broke? ... \"This time grabbing two hands, he proceeded to tug at the chains as hard as could. ... He could see that they were attached to a wall further down. ... However, as long as they were made of the same material, he believed his almighty strength should be enough to break free from them as wellHe pulled and pulled, sweat was dripping down his face, and eventually blood started to drip from around the cuffs of the bracelet the chains were attached to, and eventually he had to stop.'It's useless, it feels like those chains will never break!.'Checking himself, his body appeared to be in fine condition, not counting his self inflicted injuries at least. ... There were no markings on him whatsoever, and there were no clues as to who he was. ... He got some comfort from at least wearing clothes, yet they were too simple to give him any information about himself. ... The only thing that he found noteworthy was that he had a single earring on his left ear, but no weapons to use to break out of the room.'Well, whoever trapped me in this place can't be that stupid, but surely I had to have come in somehow?' He started to think. ... Walking towards where the chains were attached to the wall, he brushed his hand against the wall, and could feel slight bumps in the rock, and a certain watery smell.'The wall is made out of stone?' Then listening in carefully and placing his head against the wall, he could also hear the sound of what appeared to be running water.'Am I in a cave of some sort? ... If there's running water then that means there has to be an exit somewhere!'Still, as he tried to move around, touching the side of the cave walls that he was in, the chains would only allow him to go so far. ... Once again,his frustration peaked and he attempted to pull out his hair, something that seemed to be a habit of his despite him lacking any memories of it. ... While doing so, he had swung his arms up, and the blood from his wrists around the cuffs, hit his earring. ... At that moment, it started to light up. ... The earring detached itself from his lobe and fell to the ground. ... The white light started to take shape until eventually he could see it's full form. ... \"A√¢¬Ä¬¶A.. ... Pig!? ... \"\"Idiot! ... I'm a bull! ... Can't you get this right after all these years?! ... Haven't you punished me enough by naming me Ham because of this misunderstanding?! ... I clearly have a ring on my nose marking me as a bull! ... \" Ham complained as he started to fly around with his bat wings in circles out of frustration. ... \"You came from my earring... ... What- No, who are you? ... Do I know you? ... Do you know me? ... \" He asked, clinging on to hope. ... \"So they really did succeed? ... I couldn't see clearly what had happened, only hear voices but there was no time to help you. ... Alright, let's bring you up to speed. ... Your name is Fex and you're my.. ... \" Ham paused for a second as he recognised that this was a golden opportunity \"... ... and you're my servant. ... Yes, I, the mighty Ham, am you master! ... \"Fex's face told Ham that he clearly wasn't buying that. ... \"I have the power to crush the ground with my bare feet, yet you're saying I'm the servant of a little pig? ... Sorry bull, no I meant Ham! ... I doubt I would be that pathetic. ... \" Fex replied in disdain. ... \"Fine, I was just joking. ... You're not my servant, but we're really close in rank. ... Like you're just barely above me, so you have to treat me with respect, okay? ... \" Ham clarified. ... Even though Fex was unable to remember the little bull, he was aware that he might be his only chance of getting out of this place. ... \"Sure, sure. ... Say if you know who I am, then you must know someone who could help me form the outside, right? ... \" Fex asked. ... Ham thought about it for a while and he quickly recalled one particular person who had already risked their life to save Fex in the past. ... He hadn't even asked anything in return, so it was likely he would do it again. ... \"Yeah, Quinn. ... Quinn will definitely come if I call him! ... \" Ham answered excitedly, his wings started to flap with excitement. ... \"Well whoever it was, they captured me alive, so they must have a use for me. ... Otherwise, they would have just killed me. ... At some point they'll have to check up on me, or at least come to feed me. ... \" Fex stated. ... \"All you need to do is wait for the door, window or whatever it will be to open, and then fly out of here as quick as you can. ... Go call Quinn and lead him back to this place! ... \"Ham nodded. ... For once his master was relying on him and he would do whatever he could to help. ... The two of them waited patiently to proceed with their plan. ... They were unable to tell just how long they had waited and how much longer they would have to. ... Without anything better to do Ham started to fill Fex in about his past self. ... Eventually Fex's hearing allowed him to hear the sound of approaching footsteps somewhere, but in the cave it was hard to locate. ... Ham immediately flew upwards, so he would be outside the newcomer's perception. ... Soon enough a part of the cave wall moved to the side. ... For a moment Fex was happy that their plan proceeded smoothly. ... That was until he saw that what had come inside didn't look the least bit like a human. ... No, it was far too large and it bared its teeth in his direction. ... Its eyes were that of a monster, and its skin was tight with bulging muscles. ... Seeing this thing Fex could only think one thing.'It's so ugly with no hair!'As soon as the creature stepped forward, Ham immediately used the chance to slip through the gap it had come in from. ... Luckily the creature mistook the bull for a bat on account of his wings. ... Ham continued to fly through the cave, swirling, noticing that it wasn't a regular cave. ... There was a whole civilisation living here, with many beasts that looked just like the one that had entered. ... Ham didn't have time to look at them, he needed to find a way out. ... Unable to see a way he resorted to following the sound of running water. ... A few minutes later he shot outwards, finally exiting the cave. ... Looking back, he saw that he had actually been behind a waterfall.'Fex, I will come back for you! ... Quinn will save you, just like he did before! ... I know he will!' Ham thought flying off into the distance, towards the Vampire settlement.*******\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 150] Preparing: Chapter 849: Who, Who, Who? ... It was unexpected while looking for Fex that they had found Kazz instead. ... Honestly, though, when Silver had seen the trails of blood, she was worried that just maybe they had come from her brother. ... After seeing Kazz the way she was, she was a little relieved. ... Soon though, her mind went back to being the vampire knight she was, following her duty as she should be doing. ... \"It looks like she's really badly hurt, and if she's still alive, she will need help immediately. ... \" Silver stated while looking at the amount of blood in the alleyway. ... \"In a situation like this, it would be best to take her to the first castle since she belongs to that family to get treatment. ... Especially since she's a vampire knight. ... It might be best to take her to the second family, but Bryce would raise a fuss if anyone did that, so the only choice is to take her back to the first. ... The only problem is√¢¬Ä¬¶. ... \"Silver hesitated for a few seconds. ... She wanted Leo to take Kazz back but knew that it wouldn't be such a good idea due to the relation between the two families, and Leo might not know the correct procedures. ... Bryce was a person who got quite offended at certain things, which might even cause a conflict while he was there. ... Leo's straightforward personality that spoke his mind and did what he believed was best, wouldn't be good in a situation like this one. ... \"You take her, I will continue to see if there are any more clues around here. ... Besides, maybe when she wakes up, you can ask her what she knows. ... \" Leo replied, knowing full well what was on her mind. ... With a quick nod, Silver was already gone carrying away Kazz and heading to the first castle. ... Leo continued to look around, wondering if there were any different signs of aura around the place but the only thing he could see was the blood of Kazz. ... \"Kazz, is a vampire knight, and she is strong, yet someone was able to completely overpower her to the point where there were no signs of struggle. ... IF there was a fight between her and someone else, then there should at least be injuries from the other, yet there is none. ... Someone would have seen something or heard something.'It's almost as if the person had already managed to subdue her somehow, and this was the result. ... The question is. ... Why not kill her, to leave a trail? ... So that Bryce wouldn't know. ... Having fought this close, shouldn't the vampire connection have gone off? ... And√¢¬Ä¬¶ The way she was pinned up there, it was like a message, the question is for who? ... \"What this also implied though, was if Fex was involved in this somehow, he was safe as there weren't any signs of his blood around here either. ... Closing his eyes, Leo decided to increase the range of his ability. ... He could make it so he could see the auras and everything around from a bird's eye like view. ... At that moment, Leo could sense something from above. ... He had noticed something odd. ... A bat-like shape flying through the sky. ... \"I√¢¬Ä¬¶Finally√¢¬Ä¬¶made it√¢¬Ä¬¶now to the tenth castle! ... \" Ham said, covered in sweat, huffing and panting.*****Silver had eventually made it to the first castle, and it was safe to say that the guards at the gates didn't make it easier for her to enter. ... \"Move aside, you idiots! ... I have your vampire knight in my own hands. ... Will you be responsible for her death. ... What will you tell Bryce if he was to hear of his daughter's death all because you want to do your checks! ... \" As she finished her words, none other than the person's name she had just mentioned appeared. ... It was like he had responded to his name. ... He had his cane held in both hands, and the veins were seen bulging on his hand. ... \"Who! ... \" He shouted, hitting his cane against the floor. ... It was so powerful it caused the guards around them to fall to the floor. ... \"Who has attempted to attack a knight of the first family! ... \"At first, Silver thought maybe Bryce was upset due to his daughter being hurt, but she could tell based on his actions now and her fathers of the past. ... This man was just upset that someone had dared to go against his family. ... Handing her over, Kazz was quickly rushed into the castle, while Bryce continued to stare at Silver. ... He didn't even turn to look, as Kazz's beaten body went past him.'Is he waiting for me to say something? ... I need to find out what happened. ... I need to speak to Kazz when she wakes up.' But the pressure coming from Bryce's body was immense. ... \"Vampire knight, Silver Sanguinis reporting from the thirteenth family. ... \" Silver started her formal greeting bowing down. ... \"I discovered Kazz between the tenth and thirteenth castles just outside of the twelfth. ... I am unaware of what happened to her, but brought her here immediately. ... From the scene, it looks like she has been in that condition for a while. ... \"Even after mentioning this, the expression on Bryce's face didn't change, and she was wondering if he even cared about her at all. ... \"I will confirm what you say with her when she wakes up, but if it's not true.... ... \" Bryce stopped there he didn't need to say anything else and just turned around. ... \"Wait Sir! ... \" Silver shouted, when Bryce turned back, and she could see his face, the words she wanted to ask wouldn't come out. ... She wanted to be the first to ask Kazz a question, but it was clear he thought of her as a suspect and would never allow it. ... \"When she wakes up, and if she's okay would you please inform me. ... I'm worried about her, me and her are the same age and grew up together after all. ... \" She said, and turned back around, heading towards Leo hoping he had at least found something. ... While Bryce continued to walk, he was placing his walking stick, harder and stronger, into the ground. ... It was digging into the ground as if it was made of butter.'I sent Kazz to go grab Fex hoping to see how far this little development of his blood weapon had come, and now Kazz returns like this?!' Bryce thought. ... 'Did the tenth leader plan ahead. ... Did he plant something so none of his people could get hurt. ... If it is him, are you trying to start a war kid? ... It won't be the same this time, it won't be the same at all.'When Kazz finally was able to get the treatment, the medical team at the first castle found that she wasn't actually as badly hurt as she looked. ... It was more made to look that way. ... The wounds on her hand and feat had healed once she had been removed from the wall. ... But her energy was gone, she was feeling incredibly weak for some reason. ... The staff were unable to find out why, but eventually Kazz had regained some of her energy and started to wake up. ... \"Quick, inform the leader! ... \" A member of staff shouted. ... Moving slowly, Kazz started to touch her head, and touch several other parts of her body. ... \"You must have been through a lot, don't worry, the leader will be here to see you soon. ... \"Kazz looked at the girl beside her who was treating her, still squinting her eyes as if in pain. ... The staff found it a little strange, since she no longer had any injuries on her, so they were trying to figure out what she was exactly suffering from. ... \"Who are you? ... \" Kazz asked. ... The staff member smiled. ... \"Don't worry, I just work in the castle, I don't expect anyone to remember who I am. ... You are a busy person, you just get some rest. ... \"However, that wasn't what she had meant at all. ... When the door was swung open, Bryce had entered the room, and everyone had stepped aside, allowing him to pass. ... He walked, and everyone kept their heads down, bowing to the first leader. ... Eventually reaching the bed, Bryce looked at Kazz. ... \"What happened? ... \" He asked.'The same as always, he didn't even ask about her condition, or how she was feeling. ... The leader is always straight down to business. ... But this is what makes him a strong leader.' The staff members thought. ... From her bed, she looked him up and down a few times, and the squint in her eyes still remained. ... \"What happened, I don't know√¢¬Ä¬¶\" She paused. ... \"I know you must have saved me, but please tell me√¢¬Ä¬¶who are you? ... \" Kazz asked.******\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 175] Preparing: Chapter 874: Quinn vs six, fight or run? ... Looking at all the leaders in front of Quinn was quite daunting. ... Especially considering he had just had a large fight with one of the leaders in a one on one fight, now there were six in front of him. ... Perhaps Bryce was considered the strongest out of the leaders, but each leader was strong and had their own fighting style. ... The strength between each leader was different by leaps and bounds, so Quinn couldn't see himself getting out of this through a fight, nor could he picture any of the other leaders either. ... 'But maybe he could?' Quinn thought, comparing himself to a certain person. ... [Quest revived: Escape]  [Quest reward: ???]  While thinking about this, it seemed like the system had agreed with him as well. ... There was only one time the system had given him a quest similar to this one, and that was when Quinn was on the Blade family island. ... Back then, the system was very accurate, because there was no way of Quinn seeing himself winning the fight against the Blade twins, and it felt the same way now. ... Still, the question remained on what he should actually do? ... Once captured, there was a low chance that he would ever be set free. ... He was practically just giving his life to them. ... Many of the leaders disliked him and would just see this as an excuse to get rid of him. ... In terms of escaping, Quinn could use his shadow to transfer himself back to one of those at the castle and protect himself there, but based on the situation, he would have to face the power of all the other leaders attacking his castle. ... This would put the others through danger, and there was a low chance they would survive such an attack. ... Finally, the words of Muka rung through his head. ... If he was to fight back and resist, then what would happen to the tenth family? ... They would deem him an enemy of the vampire settlement. ... How far would that go? ... Would that also include everyone related to him, all members of the tenth family as well? ... Would they be punished for his actions? ... In the middle of all his thoughts, a small near enough invisible object came towards him. ... Sensing it, Quinn managed to raise his shadow and block the object. ... Seeing it now stuck in his shadow he could see it was a red soaked needle. ... \"Suzan, what are you doing? ... He hasn't decided to resist yet! ... \" Jin shouted, as he knew straight away which leader the needle had come from. ... \"That needle wasn't aiming to kill him, you know what my needles can do. ... \" She replied. ... \"Also why are we bother taking him in, I think we know full well who killed Dwight. ... Would anyone else even think of doing such a thing, but an outsider like him. ... There's no need for the rest of you to get involved. ... \" She said as she rushed in with a needle between each of her fingers. ... Seeing this, Quinn wasn't just going to let Suzan come at him and do nothing. ... He was tired of doing nothing. ... Suzan was confident, based on what she had seen Quinn do in her last fight, and this was her downfall. ... When Suzan was within range and close enough so it was nearly impossible for her to avoid, Quinn used his skill Shadow Path. ... Once it touched her feet she immediately started to slow down. ... The shadow path skill was hard to hit the further one was away, since the skill was slow to come out, but with someone as careless as her, he knew it would hit. ... Then Quinn aimed one of his fingers carefully, and fired out a blood bullet, hitting her right in the knee. ... She fell to the ground still in the shadow path. ... Out of anger on one knee, she threw out a desperate blood swipe, but Quinn simply avoided it with a flash step and threw one of his own towards her. ... Suzan wanted to move, but her leg was badly hurt and for some reason, it wasn't healing. ... Although he hadn't restored all his Qi from the fight with Bryce, Quinn had healed it enough to at least use the first stage of Qi to disrupt their healing. ... With the blood swipe coming towards her, and her leg hurt, she raised a blood barrier, but when the attack hit her barrier, it smashed right through and continued to move forward. ... The leaders who were casually watching were shocked and now knew the real danger Suzan was in. ... This caused a movement between the leaders who were only watching at the moment. ... The seventh leader Kyle and the twelfth leader Prima were on the move. ... First, Prima had moved Suzan off from the shadow and off to the side, while Kyle took off the cape on his back, and at the right moment, had engulfed the blood swipe from Quinn. ... 'He blocked my attack, but that blood wipe was infused with Qi?' Quinn thought. ... 'That cape is related to the seventh family's ability, which is why your Qi has not disrupted the flow of energy, Quinn fighting six leaders at once with all their abilities√¢¬Ä¬¶.' Vincent didn't want to say anymore, for his words would only put pressure on Quinn even more. ... \"You sc. ... u. ... m, what are you trying to do?! ... \" Prima shouted. ... \"Didn't you all see! ... \" Quinn shouted back. ... \"first, you accuse me without even telling me what evidence you have against me, and then you attack me first. ... Do I not even have the right to defend myself! ... \" Quinn asked. ... Although Quinn was unaware, the vampire leaders were now a little on edge, due to what had just happened. ... The weak leader they knew from before, was able to hurt Suzan badly, and it looked like Quinn had done everything so casually. ... What was worrying them most, was the fact that despite there being six leaders in front of him, Quinn wasn't scared. ... 'Quinn, you were only on earth for a short time. ... What happened to you?' Jin thought, remembering their first fight. ... 'Quinn, I don't know what you plan to do, but if the message was really sent out to all the leaders, the others will be here soon, if you have decided to fight, then you have to beat all of these and get out of here!.' Vincent urged. ... But it looked like the others were deciding for him, as both David the 11th leader, Prima and Kyle charged forward at once, each with their clawed hands covered in the blood arnameant. ... 'Well, they've already made a choice. ... They won't even give me a chance to explain myself, and I can't let the others get involved!' Quinn replied. ... Using Shadow Equip, Quinn equipped the mask to his face, and made contact with the castle. ... The message got through and had eventually reached Paul. ... \"Paul, this is an emergency, just listen! ... \" Quinn said as he fired out blood swipes against the others, and used his shadow to block their oncoming attacks. ... 'If his cape can block attacks, then I'll just have to use my own fists!' Quinn, took the hit from Kyle dead on, and instead delivered one of his own, clawing through and touching his skin. ... It was a hit for hit, and he knew this would cause more pain due to the fairy blood. ... The biggest problem was how fast each of the leaders were, making it impossible for Quinn to fight them all at once. ... Now with one of them screaming in pain from the fairy blood. ... The shadow was used to block an attack from Prima on his back, while he performed a hammer kick on David, breaking his arm and sending him tumbling across the floor. ... 'Is he really able to take on three of them at once?' Jin was observing the whole thing, still undecided until this point. ... 'I have to join in.'  Now, even Jin was involved with his blood explosion who had been sitting back the whole time. ... The shadow didn't work well against Jin's explosion blood ability as it took up many of his MC points. ... Seeing him join the fight, and not having taken out the other yet, Quinn needed to finish his message to Paul. ... \"Right now, I'm being accused of killing Dwight, the Royal knight. ... I don't know what's going to happen to me, and I don't know what's going to happen to the people or castle, but protect them at all cost! ... \" the message was delivered, and the call was hung up. ... *******\n",
