      "... \n",
      "When leaving the Parasites to their own devices, there was the chance that they could use this time to run away. ... To escape the planet, however, where would they even go? ... Who would they run off to? ... Wevil, had promised Quinn that he would follow him from now onwards, and to leave everything to him and Hana. ... Even though Tony was the vice leader, the faction members actually had the most respect for these two. ... Whenever something had gone wrong, they would be the ones that tried to reason with Mantis, to give them part of the antidote earlier than needed. ... While Tony would be the one who was Mantis's yes men. ... Saying Yes to every suggestion and everything he did. ... \"Alright everyone, it's time for you all to decide! ... \" Wevil shouted from on top of the platform. ... The faction members were recovering and they had gained enough strength to move again. ... But they were unaware of the bombshell that Wevil was about to drop on them all. ... \"You have a choice√¢¬Ä¬¶. ... \"*****Heading back, Quinn and Sil had no trouble and they had arrived at the shelter sooner than they thought. ... A message had been sent back ahead of time, and Peter had responded saying that Dennis was acting strangely, but that was a while ago. ... The two of them went through the teleporter and were onboard the Cursed ship, running straight for the command centre, but before they could even reach there. ... Peter was standing in the main large open hall. ... \"Quinn, did you manage to solve it? ... \" Peter asked. ... \"I didn't, but Sil can now remove the poison. ... Where are the others? ... \" Quinn asked. ... Peter led the way but didn't say much, he didn't know what to say to Quinn to prepare him for what had happened while he was on his way. ... If anything Quinn seemed to be in a happy mood that he had actually found a way to save the others. ... Then entering the training room, Quinn could see many people in the room. ... It reeked of blood, but he expected this. ... As time went on, he imagined more of them were throwing up on the ground like the others. ... Sam was present, along with Paul and Kazz. ... The two of them were standing over Dennis, Nate and Fex. ... They looked like they had been beaten a few times, but were at least still alive. ... Sil seeing them rushed over quickly and got to work removing the poison. ... Scanning the room more, he saw Linda, away from them all. ... She was sitting down on the floor with her head on her knees. ... Quinn had seen Sil do this a number of times when he was upset. ... However, what caught his attention more than that, was two things. ... First, the sound of crying coming from Linda, she was uncontrollably sobbing and even now tears were falling to the floor. ... The second thing was what was in front of her. ... A sheet had been placed over something and right at the bottom, a pair of boots could be seen sticking out from them. ... \"No, no I brought back Sil, we can get rid of the poison,\" Quinn said walking towards her. ... Seeing Linda, and the body in front of her, it didn't take long for him to put the two things together. ... When she heard someone coming closer, she looked up to see Quinn through her blurry vision. ... \"Quinn√¢¬Ä¬¶\" She cried. ... \"Blip, you can save him√¢¬Ä¬¶ Right? ... Please tell me you can save him! ... \" She continued to sob. ... It was her last hope, hoping that Kazz was wrong about what she had said. ... Kneeling down on his knees, Quinn removed the sheet to have a look underneath it, a bloody mess known as Blip. ... He closed his eyes and placed the sheet back over. ... He knew Blip was dead. ... \"I'm sorry√¢¬Ä¬¶ I'm sorry I wasn't here, I can't bring back the dead. ... \" Quinn said softly. ... Placing her head back down, she continued to sob, Quinn went to approach her, hoping to perhaps comfort her. ... \"Don't, please Quinn, just go away. ... I know it's not your fault, or Fex's but I just can't look at you right now, not for a while. ... \" Linda said. ... Quinn understood and decided to leave her be. ... She was such a strong woman and it broke his heart to see her like this, but then he was starting to wonder what happened? ... Blip wasn't infected by the poison in the first place. ... Thinking back at the image of Blip in his mind, there was something he could see on the neck. ... It was two bite marks. ... Immediately, Quinn's mind wanted to blame Kazz, and walking back towards them a strange energy was overflowing from him. ... He had enough, if Kazz was behind this, then he was unsure if he could hold himself back this time, even his gauntlets were already covered in a strange shadow. ... \"Quinn, it wasn't Kazz,\" Paul said, knowing the look in his eyes. ... Hearing this, he started to think about what Linda had said, about how she said she didn't blame him or 'Fex' for this. ... The anger started to calm down, and the shadow disappeared. ... \"But how? ... \"Everything was explained to Quinn about what had happened while they were away. ... He was kicking himself in the foot wondering, if he had stayed behind, if the outcome would have been different. ... However, Sam, Nate and Dennis all tried their best to comfort him, especially Dennis who was more thankful than even before to Quinn. ... He knew that his life was hanging on the line, and if Quin hadn't left to deal with the Parasites as quickly as he did, there was a good chance that he could be dead as well. ... Eventually, the news was released to everyone on the Cursed ship. ... A day of mourning had been given to Blip. ... It came as a shock, especially since a lot of members of the Crows had joined because of him. ... What surprised everyone even more, was Linda had yet to be seen at the morning event. ... They were expecting some type of speech from her, but nothing had occurred. ... Blip's death was blamed on the Parasites, and with that, the news of Quinn attacking them was also spread. ... They weren't informed of how he did so alone, but they couldn't have imagined a large group having acted. ... Otherwise, more faction members would have known about it. ... To them, the order of events were jumbled. ... They had thought Blip had been killed by the Parasites some ways and then Quinn went to deal with them, which just proved to all of them how much Quinn cared about their lives. ... He thought that maybe people would leave after such a thing, but they had all decided to stay. ... Showing him more respect compared to before. ... Wevil had kept to his promise. ... He was unable to get in contact with Daisy, as they were dealing with their own things, but he left them a message blaming the event on the Parasites. ... They decided to stick to the story that was spread around the Cursed faction. ... After the duel, Mantis had attacked Blip, and Quinn retaliated. ... Most of the Parasite members agreed to join under the Cursed faction, they were very thankful after the poison was removed like Wevil thought they would be. ... The members explained the situation to their families as they were unaware of what was really going on in the Parasites. ... The shelter they had could remain and now was in the process of being built permanently. ... They wanted a person to oversee this matter, and in the end, Linda was the one who volunteered. ... She had recovered a little from her brother's death, trying to act normal with everyone, but there was an odd feeling around her whenever they would converse. ... When she volunteered it came as a surprise, and they thought it might be best to give her a task like so, to get her mind off it. ... When going through the Parasite's belongings, they found that Mantis had written his own personal Poison ability book. ... It was given to Paul to look over and he had found that it had cultivation techniques that would teach someone to get their ability up to level eight. ... It was the thing he needed most right now. ... It was a tough time for the Cursed faction, but Paul reminded them that many more tough times were probably to come in the future, even though big things were happening they couldn't just take a break. ... They needed to proceed with their plan. ... The plan that would place them in prime position to become part of the big three. ... A powerhouse of the human race. ... In those two days, wiping the sweat from his head, Alex looked at the last piece of equipment on his table.'Finally the emperor tier equipment.. ... is done.'****For MVS artwork and updates follow on Instagram and Facebook: jksmanga\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 538] Preparing: Chapter 1239: Defeat? ... Watching the fight so far, Graham had actually been paying close attention to everything that had been going on. ... He had a keen eye, and despite only having briefly seen the faces of the people on the livestream once, he had remembered them all.'That person, they called him the Cursed faction leader. ... I was told to keep an eye on him, I never knew he was on that planet.' Graham thought. ... 'Earlier when the camera panned, he was just off by the sides, so why now of all times? ... Is it because his people are in trouble? ... No, if that was the case then he could have jumped in when the first lot did.'His mind started to go through all the possible calculations, and eventually he turned his head to the Dalki that was in his container, now having died. ... He went over to the computer to check back what had occured. ... That's when he could see that moments before the Dalki's death, its brain waves were changing, almost becoming non-existent. ... This had all happened before the Dalki had lost its life. ... \"The words spoken and the Cursed faction leader joining the fight, on top of the Dalki switching over sides, this can't all be coincidence. ... Slicer√¢¬Ä¬¶I'm afraid you might be in real trouble.'Watching the fight, through the screen, Quinn had been able to gather a few things. ... The five spiked Dalki's speed was great. ... Nearly on its last legs, it was even more powerful than anything he had encountered and there was one part of it that could move faster than any other, its tail. ... If it wasn't for Hilston having his armour, or teleportation ability he would have been caught by it a lot earlier in the fight. ... Having drained the energy from his original body a while ago, Quinn wasn't sure how strong his body would be when he returned, but he made use of the amulet's ability to allow him to drain those he had Marked. ... To his surprise, when doing so not only did he get the one spiked now two spiked Dalki energy back, but the energy he had transferred to the Dalki as well, so Quinn was not only back in top shape, but was even better. ... The only thing was, after having suffered a defeat, he knew he couldn't hold back. ... The active skill on the armour set, was to give him full speed so now he was on a timer, as such he activated his soul weapon, giving him unlimited access and full control over the shadow.'Still, this isn't enough, I lost to that five spike and I saw how much Hilston struggled to hurt it. ... I need something else.'Although, Quinn's armour was a high tier one, it was not strong enough to block any attacks coming from that tail. ... Its sharpness had already been proven by its ability to even cut through the Demon tier Armour, but there was one thing that could work. ... Shadows appeared over Quinn's hand, and now he was wielding a long Katana like blade. ... \"A sword?! ... What the hell is Quinn doing bringing out a sword in a time like this?! ... Quinn isn't a master swordsman like Leo, so why would he use that in a serious fight?! ... \" Fex complained. ... \"Maybe it isn't Quinn, and it's the other person. ... \" Sam suggested, but even if it was the real Quinn, he knew he wouldn't pull out a sword for no reason at all. ... Slicer had mostly disregarded Quinn up until now, instead focusing towards what she perceived to be the most troublesome one, the young blonde haired boy who had defeated Hilston. ... She swung her fast tail at him and Borden and Sil were unable to react to it. ... Sil had super speed, but if he was to move out of the way, Borden would likely be killed, with the rest following right after. ... Still, his hardening wasn't strong enough to block the tail, and yet a clang was heard as the tail struck against something. ... Quinn could be seen there with the sword in his hand, he had blocked the attack. ... \"Sil, I'm going to need your help, and the help of the rest of your family over there. ... Just concentrate on the strongest attack you can produce, and leave the defense to me! ... \" Quinn shouted, releasing a large wave of Qi. ... The tail was pushed back but only a little bit, and soon he was being overpowered.'So I guess that answers that question, a five spike is stronger than me, even when I use all of my Qi. ... I guess I can only rely on my shadow.' Quinn thought as a shadow was being used to block the tail. ... Of course, Slicer didn't stop there and started to move her colossal tail, attacking multiple places, yet the boosted Quinn was able to match that speed and stop it with the sword slightly, moving back using his shadow as well. ... \"How! ... How are you able to stop my attack! ... \" Slicer shouted with anger. ... With Quinn's soul weapon he didn't have a limit on how much shadow he could use, but the shadow was still slower than Slicer's primary tail. ... However, with Nitro acceleration he could match up in speed, and use the sword to block the attack. ... As for the sword itself, Quinn never thought it would be used in a situation like so, but thanks to Longblade, he had been given the sword that seemed useless but had one trait, that it was unbreakable. ... The extra speed, Qi, his vampire strength, and the energy his Demon tier Amulet had allowed him to drain, all factored into him gaining enough power to slightly push back against Slicer's tail. ... \"Everyone! ... \" Quinn shouted, continuing to block each attack with his sword. ... Although the blade could be held with one hand, he was holding it with two due to the sheer strength behind each attack. ... The tail was keeping the two of them at a distance from each other so he was unable to touch her with his gauntlets to drain her either. ... \"We might only get one chance at this, so attack with everything you got. ... We need to kill her! ... Right now, all of our planets are under attack! ... They think they can just walk over us, well I won't let them! ... \" Quinn shouted, as he held the sword with only one hand. ... His muscles bulged. ... He didn't know how much longer he could continue to block the attacks this way or at all, but he had to do something. ... Multiple shadow portals started to appear around the area where Slicer was at. ... At the same time, without her knowledge, consumed by the rage of not being able to defeat the opponent in front of her, a shadow was covering the sand and had now reached underneath her feet as well.'It looks like Hilston did a number on your wings and I have to thank him for that!'Now with the shadow portals open, Quinn ran back out of range of the tail. ... He placed the sword away, and started to run forward. ... He didn't have much time, as the active skill was running out, but now he had to rely on his body to avoid all of the tail strikes. ... Moving left, right, piles of sand were chucked up and that's when Slicer noticed something.'My attacks, they have slowed down!'It was the effect of the shadow path she was standing on that had covered the wide area in shadow. ... With this, Quinn could avoid the attacks more easily under the effects of his boost. ... He soon threw his red blood disks out into two of the shadow portals by his side, while running forward, and they all started to appear from the shadows that were scattered around Slicer.'Kill, I have to kill the Dalki! ... I have to get stronger, to beat him!' Was running through Quinn's head, and a mist started to appear from his back.'I shall help you with your desire.' The voice said, as another portal appeared from behind. ... It was the Boneclaw which was as large as the Dalki itself. ... With its giant claws, it had pierced Slicer back. ... The almost impenetrable skin had been penetrated with ease. ... She screamed out in pain and swung her colossal tail, hoping to cut the Boneclaw, once hit it had turned back into the black mist and disappeared once more, but the familiar had already done a number on her. ... It also gave Quinn enough time to sprint forward, and with his two blood drills he was ready. ... Now, standing behind the five spiked Dalki, Borden, Raten and Vorden were ready to follow up the Boneclaw's attack. ... Quinn thrusted both blood drills directly into the five spiked Dalki's chest. ... The blood continued to spin in place, attempting to pierce the skin, but it seemed impossible. ... However, Slicer soon felt another force, pushing her from behind. ... Borden, Raten and Sil used their strength at the same time, hitting the Dalki from all sides, to prevent her from flying away. ... Still, they were unable to peirce the body, but the Qi had done a lot of internal damage. ... Moving out of the way, Quinn's nitro accelerate time was up. ... \"It's up to you. ... \" Quinn said, keeping his shadow ready just in case. ... It was an emergency measure, so that Quinn would be able to temporarily put Slicer in the Shadow lock, and keep her there hopefully long enough for everyone else to escape. ... When Quinn moved though, it was to allow one last attack to go through. ... A lightning attack that was being made, by now the combination of the strongest ability users in existence. ... Sil, Pai and Vicky, had jumped up, and started to spin their bodies as the three of them had turned their bodies into gigantic lightning bolts. ... Due to the three of them being together, they were able to create one giant lightning bolt strike. ... Slicer was far more injured than she had perceived as she had never felt this way before.'I have to√¢¬Ä¬¶get away.' It was the first time her instincts told her to flee instead of continuing a fight. ... Alas, she could see nothing but a bright light in front of her. ... Skimming her hand over her chest, she felt that her scales had been damaged a little.'That black haired person√¢¬Ä¬¶is dangerous' Was her last thought, as she was struck by the lightning bolt that had passed right through her. ... Sil, Pai, and Vicky were seen on the other side. ... Looking back only to see half of Slicer's body completely missing. ... \"They did it, they did it! ... They defeated the five spiked Dalki! ... \" Bonny announced it to the whole world. ... At the same time, Quinn heard a familiar ding sound.******\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 547] Preparing: Chapter 1248: Arthur Switch sides? ... Hearing Arthur's name was like a switch in Quinn's mind. ... He never expected to hear the name from another person's lips, especially a human. ... To make sure, Quinn sniffed a few times. ... The scent was definitely that of a human. ... \"Why! ... \" Quinn said, pushing forward now almost directly in Ruby's face. ... \"Why do you know that name? ... How do you know him? ... Who are You? ... \"Asking one question after another, Quinn pushed forward, and Ruby was taking a step back. ... The person in front of her was being somewhat aggressive, and it felt like if she said one wrong word, she would be on the receiving end of an attack. ... Instead of answering, she slowly moved her hands down to the hilt of the sword she had been practically hugging till recently, but this didn't go unnoticed by Quinn. ... \"Don't you try to use that weapon on me. ... \" Quinn demanded as his eyes glowed red and his influence skill had activated. ... No matter how hard Ruby tried to move her hand, her body wouldn't listen to her as it was being controlled.'Those red eyes are the same as Arthur's. ... I thought that maybe the two of them knew each other. ... Is he going to kill me ?' She thought. ... \"Quinn! ... What are you doing! ... \" Nathan shouted out as he got in between the two of them. ... \"Look, I don't know who this Arthur person is, Ruby does know him, but you can't just ask a question and put pressure on someone like that the second you meet them. ... You didn't even give her time to answer. ... \"I know this might be out of place since I am ranked below you, but I have to call out your actions. ... Do you want to be like Duke! ... \" Nathan shouted, trying to get Quinn's head screwed back on properly. ... Letting go of the Influence skill, Quinn took a step back. ... He realised that he had allowed his emotions to get the better of him, similar to when he had faced Head general Innu. ... This wasn't Innu though, and neither was it Arthur himself.'I have to calm myself down when it comes to situations involving Arthur. ... Every time I hear his name, the wounds on my body start to ache a little.'\"I understand the young one,\" Eno said, walking up to Quinn's side. ... \"I too am interested in knowing just how this girl came into possession of the Demon tier weapon and her relationship with Arthur. ... \"It took a few seconds for Nathan to notice who it was, but it was then that he recognised the man as Richard Eno. ... Immediately he bowed down, showing his respect to one of the great heroes. ... \"I'm sorry,\" Quinn said, looking at Ruby again. ... \"I'm just trying to find him and wondering what he is doing at the moment. ... Do you mind if you tell me what you know about him? ... \"Many things were running through Ruby's mind when she saw Quinn use the shadow powers. ... Whether he was a friend of Arthur, an Enemy or perhaps someone who was just searching for him, but now she realised that they both had similar goals. ... The group started to make their way into the cursed ship. ... While doing so, Ruby had explained just like she did with Nathan, who Arthur was and how he was introduced into the Shelter they had made.'What she's saying matches up with what Leo and Erin told me before, how they had trained with Arthur on the planet. ... So she is from the place where we woke up Arthur and must be part of those that were left behind when the portal planet changed.' \"So you don't really know why the Dalki were protecting the place? ... \" Quinn asked. ... \"I hate to say It, but it is looking more and more likely that Arthur is working for the other side now. ... He must have made some sort of deal to have the Dalki protect them. ... Arthur is a strong ally for them to have, which is why they went as far as to have One Horn keep their promise. ... \" After finishing this sentence, Eno had a smile on his face. ... \"However, in their rush to attack, you have managed to do a great thing. ... You have made it, so their deal is void. ... \"\"Who is this Arthur person you keep speaking of? ... \" Nathan couldn't help but ask. ... \"From the sound of it, it is a great figure, but I have never heard of such a name. ... \"\"If I said he was someone who is stronger than Quinn, then I bet that would get your attention, so it is important to know if he is working for the Dalki or not,\" Eno answered. ... Hearing this, Nathan stopped walking for a few seconds. ... Right now, it wouldn't be wrong to say that Quinn was the strongest person in the world. ... At least, from who they knew, yet an unknown was stronger than him. ... \"Wait, but Arthur said, I mean Ruby said that Arthur said the Dalki were even stronger than him! ... What does that mean! ... \" Nathan shouted out, recalling her words. ... Now, both Quinn and Eno had stopped walking at the same time. ... \"It's true,\" Ruby added, looking at the shock on their faces. ... She didn't really know who this Quinn person was because they had been kept away from the outside world, so she also didn't know what the big deal was that someone was stronger than him, or Arthur for that matter. ... \"When Arthur came back with the Dalki, he said those words. ... \"Thinking things through, Quinn was trying to compare Arthur's strength with Slicers. ... From both fights and what he had seen Arthur do before, out of a hundred fights with Slicer, Quinn couldn't imagine Arthur losing a single one of them.'Could it be, did Arthur already have a scuffle with the Dalki, did he lose? ... Is that why he attacked me that time with the Demon tier beast and told me to get stronger. ... Because not even he could beat the Dalki?'This was the only thing he could think of, but to know for sure, he had to know the deal made with the humans. ... The only thing he could think of was if Arthur really thought the Dalki was going to win this war. ... His deal was for the Shelter to be saved. ... Did he get attached to those at the Shelter so quickly? ... \"About what you said earlier,\" Ruby added. ... \"Even if the Dalki aren't protecting us anymore and we have escaped, I think Arthur would still help them because they still have my.... ... daughter. ... Arthur and Minny, the two of them, would always go off together, but one day she had gone missing, and it was around the same time Arthur appeared with them. ... I know Arthur wouldn't hurt her! ... \"Looking to his right, Quinn could see that Eno was in deep thought as well. ... Perhaps someone being stronger than Arthur was never in his calculations. ... Eno had the insight to see far ahead, but there were things even he couldn't predict. ... \"What are you thinking? ... \" Quinn asked. ... \"The timeline,\" Eno replied. ... \"You see, if you asked me, could the Dalki get strong enough to defeat Arthur? ... My answer would have been yes, but judging by when these people were being protected by the Dalki, and when you claimed you were attacked by him. ... It would mean that at that time, they already had someone strong enough to deal with Arthur. ... \"If that is true and was the case, then that said person or Dalki is now even stronger than back then. ... The Dalki are improving quicker than my predictions. ... They might have a six spike already among them, or one that is very close to evolving. ... \"It was a scary thought to even imagine what a six spike would be like. ... For the rest of the walk, there was silence among them all. ... Finally, the group had entered the meeting room, where Logan and Sam were present inside. ... It looked like the command centre had not only been repaired but improvements had been made to the room as well. ... The main table that would sit a level above all the controls was now twice the size it was before. ... The centre and the table itself could still be used as a holographic display, and it looked like it was being used as one now. ... Currently being projected into the meeting, was Owen, Helen, and Samantha. ... The holograms looked life-like as if they were actually present in the room. ... From the smell alone, Quinn knew they weren't. ... In the room already, other than Sam and Logan, was the new Supreme commander Sach. ... \"Quinn, we were just talking about you,\" Sach said with a smile. ... \"We were all discussing the video of you beating the five spike. ... \"At first, Quinn thought that maybe the meeting had started without him, but it looked like everyone was just chatting and getting along with one another. ... \"Oh, I see you have brought some others with you as well,\" Sach said, surprised, but he wasn't the only one. ... \"Mona, my word, I thought you had perished, darling,\" Owen said, spooked, thinking he had seen a ghost. ... \"I'm harder to kill than you think, and I have this person to thank for that,\" Mona said, pointing towards Richard Eno. ... The group took to their seats now the meeting was about to start. ... Sach was going to take the lead, giving everyone an update on all of the current situations, but before he even could, Eno stood up. ... \"I have come bringing urgent news to everyone. ... This whole war that you are all facing, is a giant trap! ... The Dalki don't care about the beast planets. ... This is just a distraction from their real goal. ... What they really are after, is planet earth. ... \"We have to do everything we can to protect planet earth, no more importantly protect Blade island. ... It's time you all knew the truth about the Dalki. ... \" Eno explained.******\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 561] Preparing: Chapter 1262: The real killer? ... Once more, an emergency council meeting was abruptly called between the leaders, barely any time had passed since the last. ... Even stranger was the fact that it had been called in the third castle. ... Causing some of the leaders to question its importance. ... Some were complaining thinking that the castle had come into some sort of disagreement as to who to select as their new leader, and now they were to cast a vote. ... When the leaders arrived, they thought that they would head to the throne room, but instead they were led to one of the many dining rooms. ... The situation was getting odder by the second and when they saw several Royal guards standing outside it didn't exactly clear things up for them. ... Muka had just arrived and when he entered, he found the other leaders already discussing things amongst themselves. ... Apart from Paul, who stood off on his own to the side, looking at the situation.'What in the√¢¬Ä¬¶' Muka was staring at the blood message on the wall, and Annie's body which had at one point fallen to the floor, with nobody having bothered to pick her up. ... It might have been the first time in vampire history that the third family had suffered so much in such a short time frame. ... \"The King apologises for being unable to attend this meeting. ... \" Royal Knight Kyle announced. ... \"However, His Majesty has tasked me to deliver a message on his behalf based on what you see around you. ... \"\"The message is as follows: 'If any of you have doubted it, see for yourself what the Punisher has done. ... He has taken yet another life right from underneath our noses. ... His message on the wall is a clear sign that he wishes to challenge us all, a promise that he will be coming for us all. ... Not only us, but our children as well. ... Only he knows how far he will go. ... We have to put a stop to him now or he will attempt to get rid of every vampire in the settlement!' \"The majority of those attending clearly agreed with that statement. ... Annie hadn't even been officially made the third leader, yet she had met such a cruel end. ... However, not all of them were shocked and in fear as they tried to figure out just what was going on.'If this really is Arthur's doing, why did he target the third family twice?' Muka wondered. ... 'Could there really be something Annie knew that Suzan didn't? ... No, that should be impossible. ... She was practically a shut-in. ... Still, this time he left us a message, telling us about him having a list√¢¬Ä¬¶ did he intend to start with all those from the third family and move on from there?'It wasn't really a meeting, the leaders were talking with each other freely, but with no real agenda set up and the King absent, the other leaders eventually left the place not long after the Royal knights had excused themselves. ... Some walking more in a hurry than others. ... However, a few of the leaders had decided to stay to take a closer look at the murder scene. ... Aside from Muka there was Sunny, and Jin. ... Similar to last time, the room had no signs of struggles or fighting in it. ... There was the broken door, but it looked as if the guards were already in the middle of repairing it, while having left the rest of the scene untouched. ... Making Muka think it was someone else's doing. ... It looked like apart from the message their only clue was the dead body. ... \"Does anyone else find it strange? ... \" Sunny asked. ... \"The way Suzan was killed by Arthur? ... When we look at Suzan's death it was a clear fear tactic statement, and you could say this is the same again, but the message here, it was clearly left behind for us, while the first had been for the public to see. ... \"\"Does that really matter? ... \" Jin questioned, unable to see Sunny's point. ... \"Perhaps Arthur had hoped for a certain outcome after Suzan's death, but with us not reacting how he wanted, this time he left behind a clearer message? ... \"Jin walked up to the wall and looked over the message as if hoping it would reveal some sort of secret underneath. ... \"Or whoever these people are that he has annoyed. ... This list of his, and the words after. ... I'm sure you have noticed it, some of the other leaders are afraid, more shaken up by this than us and frightened. ... Surely, they know something that we don't. ... Maybe Arthur wants them to tell the whole settlement what they did. ... \"Sunny stood up and walked up to the blood message on the wall standing by Jin's side. ... \"I think we all knew that from the beginning. ... Have you ever thought about how Bryce managed to get so many votes for himself? ... The ones frightened were the same ones who he had wrapped around his finger since day one. ... \" Sunny pointed out, while she started to sniff the wall. ... Her nose was far more sensitive than her companions. ... \"You're missing my point. ... Look at the bodies as well. ... This time, it was a single strike through the heart, a rather painless death. ... Now think back to how Suzan was killed. ... Only one of those completely disrespects the deceased's body. ... To top things off, the blood on this wall smells slightly different from Annie's blood. ... \" He understood that things were strange, otherwise Jin wouldn't have stayed behind in the first place to see if there was anything he could find, but he thought that Sunny was perhaps trying to grasp at straws too much. ... When dealing with murder and revenge, people couldn't really be expected to stay reasonable with their actions or thoughts. ... \"No, you're not the only one that thinks Suzan's death was out of the ordinary. ... \" Muka stated, answering her first question. ... \"This blood... ... \" Sunny murmured to herself, closing her eyes so her senses were better. ... \"I have never smelt blood quite like what's on the wall, but there is one thing I'm sure about, it's not Annie's. ... If that's the case, then maybe this message was written in Arthur's own blood. ... \"\"I sense pain, through his actions, someone who doesn't even like what he is doing. ... However, the first body was different. ... You're right, Jin, perhaps they are the same actions of the same person, but if that is so, then the person would be in two different states of mind. ... \"At the tenth castle, before the meeting had been called for the vampire's leaders to attend again, Paul was busy sending off both Erin and Leo. ... The teleporter needed to be activated by him, only once getting in touch with Logan. ... Then when turned on at the other end, they could go through safely. ... \"I hope you are able to contain the chaos so there won't be too much for us to do when we come back. ... I'm getting old. ... \" Leo said with a smile. ... \"You may be blind but you should at least know that I am the same age as you. ... Besides, what does age matter to us now? ... \" Paul joked, both aware that their bodies felt stronger than they had done even back in their prime. ... After stepping through the teleporter, Erin and Leo found themselves in the familiar metal and white room. ... They both knew that they were finally back on the Cursed ship. ... It felt like it had been an exceptionally long time, for Erin at least.'Every time I leave this place, I think it's only going to be for a short while, but it always ends up being longer.' Erin realised with a slight grimace. ... As for the one to greet them on the other side, it was none other than Sam. ... He knew how much the two meant to Quinn, so he couldn't just send anyone to see how they were doing. ... \"I'm glad to find both of you in great health. ... Honestly, I was half expecting one of you to come back with a missing arm or leg of some sort. ... Paul told me that you would eventually return to the Vampire World. ... \"\"Unfortunately, Quinn isn't here at the moment, but the rest of the gang is. ... It would be nice if you both stopped by and talked to them. ... I'm sure you have a lot to chat about. ... I guess you haven't seen the video either. ... \"\"What video? ... \" Erin asked, confused. ... The video Sam was talking about, was the one that nearly everyone had seen. ... Of course, in the middle of the woods fighting, Leo and Erin had no clue what Quinn and the others had been through during their time away. ... \"I guess we do have a lot of catching up to do. ... What brings you here anyway? ... \" Sam asked. ... \"Weapons. ... \" Leo answered. ... \"We were hoping to meet up with Alex and get him to forge a few new weapons for us. ... Ours might be a little dull for what we are about to face. ... \"Hearing this, Sam had the biggest grin possible on his face. ... \"Well, I was going to save this for later, but Quinn did leave me something in case you would return. ... I'm sure you will greatly appreciate his 'little' gift. ... \"******\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 577] Preparing: Chapter 1278: Planned or not? ... The light from the tablet started to dye down, and Layla could finally see Quinn removing his hand from the tablet. ... She expected Quinn to look half defeated as so far he had been. ... Especially based on the faces she had seen him pull while his hand was on the tablet, but instead, she saw a smile on his face.'Did he find the answer he was looking for?' Layla wondered. ... Seeing Quinn's smile gave a warm feeling in Layla's heart as well.'My emotions, they are all over the place. ... Is it because of the subclass?' Her vampire subclass caused her emotions to be more heightened than usual. ... She had experienced this before, sadness, anger, and happiness. ... All of these emotions would be multiplied compared to before she was turned. ... But it was also what allowed her to evolve into her other forms. ... The stronger the emotion, the more strength she had. ... On top of this, she also noticed that the sword she had given to Quinn was no longer rattling. ... When she was next to the tablet, Layla had attempted to touch it herself. ... While holding the sword, there was no such effect for her.'You are a special one, aren't you?' Layla thought, and before she knew it, Quinn was directly in front of her, handing the sword back over. ... \"I didn't really find out much about the sword\", Quinn said. ... \"Just that it used to belong to someone else a long time ago. ... It looks like you can keep on using it with no worries. ... Speaking of, have you ever heard of anyone named Bliss? ... \" Quinn asked. ... He knew it was a long shot, but Layla and the others did live a life before him, and there was a time when she was at Pure for a good while. ... Perhaps she had met this person at some point, but soon seeing her shake her head, Quinn realised that this wasn't going to be an easy task. ... \"Maybe the Divine being? ... \" Quinn asked again, referring to the name the system had given her rather than the one Ray had. ... Still, Layla shook her head. ... Layla found it a bit strange that Quinn was looking for someone after touching the tablet, and she wanted to ask why. ... Still, he seemed to be in deep thought. ... He was thinking about how to complete the next part of the quest. ... While also a little annoyed that he hadn't received anything for finding out about his Talen family bloodline.'Is it because I received another quest straight after? ... Maybe this is like a chain, and I won't get the real reward until I complete the whole thing.' Quinn wondered. ... More importantly, he needed to figure out how to find this person. ... Although Ray said there was a chance she would come to him, why hadn't she done so far? ... Everyone knew who he was. ... The Blade's could get to him, so he was sure if someone was looking for him, they would have been able to find him. ... \"You know, if you're looking for someone, maybe she should ask Logan,\" Layla suggested. ... \"He has access to military files and more information than we can imagine. ... I would guess he could find whoever you are looking for, but with just a first name like Bliss, I don't know how much it would help. ... \"It was a good suggestion to make, and Quinn certainly would ask Logan, but he had a feeling it wouldn't work either.'I have never heard of this Bliss character either.' Vincent said. ... 'But you have to remember. ... The person in the tablet said he had lived 1000 years ago. ... If this is a friend of his, or someone that knew him, then maybe many don't know who this person is.'However, there are those that have also lived for 1000 of years that might know the answer, and one of them is on this very island.''Please.' Quinn almost begged Vincent, hoping that he wasn't suggesting what he was suggesting. ... After his mood had just picked up again, was he really telling him to see if Eno knew who Bliss or the Divine being was?'Alright... ... I guess I can't help it, and I need to talk to him at some point anyway.' Quinn sighed. ... 'Even if our views or morals are different, our goals are the same for now.'\"Layla, I just wanted to say thanks for being by my side this whole time. ... Why don't you meet up with Sam, catch up on whatever plans he has at the moment, and then come back to me? ... There's something else I need to do. ... \" Quinn said. ... Not wanting to waste any more time, Quinn ran off, heading towards the castle's direction. ... Judging by the fact that Quinn was heading that way and not speaking to Sam himself, Layla could tell who he was going to talk to. ... 'I just hope nothing happens between the two of them.' Layla thought, making her way towards the castle herself. ... It didn't take long with Quinn's speed to find Eno, and it wasn't hard to find him since he had remained at the same place Quinn had last seen him, on top of the castle. ... His back was facing away from Quinn while Brock was looking towards him. ... He knew that Eno knew Quinn was there, yet still didn't turn around, and seeing the red blood armour, Quinn had many thoughts running through his head.'The blood armour, Eno had it all this time, and the other vampires didn't even know about it. ... I guess this is someone who even tricked Arthur, someone who he allowed to call him friends even knowing what he did.'I also can't help but think that this isn't the only thing that Eno is hiding.' Quinn thought. ... What stood out to Quinn as well was the crown-like figure on his head. ... He hadn't seen that before, not even on Arthurs set, and he was sure it wasn't just for show. ... \"I hope you haven't come back here to give me a lecture because if so, you are better off continuing what you were doing before\", Eno replied. ... From the castle, Eno had a clear view of what Quinn was doing, and perhaps he had even figured out what was happening, but Quinn knew that he couldn't hear the conversation he had just had. ... Otherwise he would understand why he was here. ... \"I wanted to ask you something, something about-'Just as Quinn was about to ask his question, he saw Brock turn around and look the other way. ... Quinn also stopped mid-speech because he could hear it as well. ... He quickly ran to the edge of the castle wall and looked out far in the distance, where the vast blue sea could be seen. ... Large giant circles were opening all over the place. ... They looked similar to the portals that everyone used, but there was no device to activate them. ... Seemingly they had just opened up out of thin air over the ocean floating there. ... Not just one but around twenty or so. ... The real worry was that they weren't small portals for humans either, and before they knew it. ... Several spaceships, around ten from each portal, had come through the teleporters. ... There were so many ships that Quinn couldn't keep count of them, and they were now all moving towards the Blade island. ... What stood out about them was they didn't look like Dalki ships. ... \"How many√¢¬Ä¬¶.. ... how many have they sent to this island? ... \" Quinn said. ... \"I had a feeling he would go all out,\" Eno said, looking out still unmoving, but his fist was tense. ... \"Jim, why do this much?' Vincent thought. ... Those in the castle weren't the only ones that had reacted to this. ... Unexpectedly, even though the ships had yet to reach the island. ... The Demon tier beast finally looked like it had decided to wake up. ... Its heavy feet hit the ground, shaking it slightly as it stood upright, then looking to the sky, it opened its mouth wide before letting out an almighty roar. ... Beasts in the trees and birds flew out, scared of staying on the island, and everyone who didn't know what was going on, now knew something was happening. ... The roar was so loud that Quinn had covered his ears, and when the sound had calmed, he looked over at the beast.'No.. ... no, no no!' Quinn thought. ... Looking at the teleporter, Quinn could see that it had been smashed into small pieces. ... He didn't know when, but he could see the giant Dragon's tail moving back and forth next to it, but still a little distance away. ... He could only imagine it had collided with the teleporter near the tablet. ... \"That was not what I expected. ... The beast has never gotten within a certain range of the tablet before, so I thought it was safe even from the Demon tier beast. ... \" Eno said. ... \"However, it just means that there is no retreat for any of us. ... If we want to survive this, then we have to fight all out. ... With our lives on the line. ... \"There was something inside Quinn that believed, after hearing those words, that the teleporter being destroyed wasn't accidental at all. ... Eno wanted to end it here, whether the Cursed faction wanted to or not.******My Werewolf System has finally arrived on the Web Novel! ...
