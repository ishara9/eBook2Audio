      "When leaving the Parasites to their own devices, there was the chance that they could use this time to run away. ... To escape the planet, however, where would they even go? ... Who would they run off to? ... Wevil, had promised Quinn that he would follow him from now onwards, and to leave everything to him and Hana. ... Even though Tony was the vice leader, the faction members actually had the most respect for these two. ... Whenever something had gone wrong, they would be the ones that tried to reason with Mantis, to give them part of the antidote earlier than needed. ... While Tony would be the one who was Mantis's yes men. ... Saying Yes to every suggestion and everything he did. ... \"Alright everyone, it's time for you all to decide! ... \" Wevil shouted from on top of the platform. ... The faction members were recovering and they had gained enough strength to move again. ... But they were unaware of the bombshell that Wevil was about to drop on them all. ... \"You have a choice√¢¬Ä¬¶. ... \"*****Heading back, Quinn and Sil had no trouble and they had arrived at the shelter sooner than they thought. ... A message had been sent back ahead of time, and Peter had responded saying that Dennis was acting strangely, but that was a while ago. ... The two of them went through the teleporter and were onboard the Cursed ship, running straight for the command centre, but before they could even reach there. ... Peter was standing in the main large open hall. ... \"Quinn, did you manage to solve it? ... \" Peter asked. ... \"I didn't, but Sil can now remove the poison. ... Where are the others? ... \" Quinn asked. ... Peter led the way but didn't say much, he didn't know what to say to Quinn to prepare him for what had happened while he was on his way. ... If anything Quinn seemed to be in a happy mood that he had actually found a way to save the others. ... Then entering the training room, Quinn could see many people in the room. ... It reeked of blood, but he expected this. ... As time went on, he imagined more of them were throwing up on the ground like the others. ... Sam was present, along with Paul and Kazz. ... The two of them were standing over Dennis, Nate and Fex. ... They looked like they had been beaten a few times, but were at least still alive. ... Sil seeing them rushed over quickly and got to work removing the poison. ... Scanning the room more, he saw Linda, away from them all. ... She was sitting down on the floor with her head on her knees. ... Quinn had seen Sil do this a number of times when he was upset. ... However, what caught his attention more than that, was two things. ... First, the sound of crying coming from Linda, she was uncontrollably sobbing and even now tears were falling to the floor. ... The second thing was what was in front of her. ... A sheet had been placed over something and right at the bottom, a pair of boots could be seen sticking out from them. ... \"No, no I brought back Sil, we can get rid of the poison,\" Quinn said walking towards her. ... Seeing Linda, and the body in front of her, it didn't take long for him to put the two things together. ... When she heard someone coming closer, she looked up to see Quinn through her blurry vision. ... \"Quinn√¢¬Ä¬¶\" She cried. ... \"Blip, you can save him√¢¬Ä¬¶ Right? ... Please tell me you can save him! ... \" She continued to sob. ... It was her last hope, hoping that Kazz was wrong about what she had said. ... Kneeling down on his knees, Quinn removed the sheet to have a look underneath it, a bloody mess known as Blip. ... He closed his eyes and placed the sheet back over. ... He knew Blip was dead. ... \"I'm sorry√¢¬Ä¬¶ I'm sorry I wasn't here, I can't bring back the dead. ... \" Quinn said softly. ... Placing her head back down, she continued to sob, Quinn went to approach her, hoping to perhaps comfort her. ... \"Don't, please Quinn, just go away. ... I know it's not your fault, or Fex's but I just can't look at you right now, not for a while. ... \" Linda said. ... Quinn understood and decided to leave her be. ... She was such a strong woman and it broke his heart to see her like this, but then he was starting to wonder what happened? ... Blip wasn't infected by the poison in the first place. ... Thinking back at the image of Blip in his mind, there was something he could see on the neck. ... It was two bite marks. ... Immediately, Quinn's mind wanted to blame Kazz, and walking back towards them a strange energy was overflowing from him. ... He had enough, if Kazz was behind this, then he was unsure if he could hold himself back this time, even his gauntlets were already covered in a strange shadow. ... \"Quinn, it wasn't Kazz,\" Paul said, knowing the look in his eyes. ... Hearing this, he started to think about what Linda had said, about how she said she didn't blame him or 'Fex' for this. ... The anger started to calm down, and the shadow disappeared. ... \"But how? ... \"Everything was explained to Quinn about what had happened while they were away. ... He was kicking himself in the foot wondering, if he had stayed behind, if the outcome would have been different. ... However, Sam, Nate and Dennis all tried their best to comfort him, especially Dennis who was more thankful than even before to Quinn. ... He knew that his life was hanging on the line, and if Quin hadn't left to deal with the Parasites as quickly as he did, there was a good chance that he could be dead as well. ... Eventually, the news was released to everyone on the Cursed ship. ... A day of mourning had been given to Blip. ... It came as a shock, especially since a lot of members of the Crows had joined because of him. ... What surprised everyone even more, was Linda had yet to be seen at the morning event. ... They were expecting some type of speech from her, but nothing had occurred. ... Blip's death was blamed on the Parasites, and with that, the news of Quinn attacking them was also spread. ... They weren't informed of how he did so alone, but they couldn't have imagined a large group having acted. ... Otherwise, more faction members would have known about it. ... To them, the order of events were jumbled. ... They had thought Blip had been killed by the Parasites some ways and then Quinn went to deal with them, which just proved to all of them how much Quinn cared about their lives. ... He thought that maybe people would leave after such a thing, but they had all decided to stay. ... Showing him more respect compared to before. ... Wevil had kept to his promise. ... He was unable to get in contact with Daisy, as they were dealing with their own things, but he left them a message blaming the event on the Parasites. ... They decided to stick to the story that was spread around the Cursed faction. ... After the duel, Mantis had attacked Blip, and Quinn retaliated. ... Most of the Parasite members agreed to join under the Cursed faction, they were very thankful after the poison was removed like Wevil thought they would be. ... The members explained the situation to their families as they were unaware of what was really going on in the Parasites. ... The shelter they had could remain and now was in the process of being built permanently. ... They wanted a person to oversee this matter, and in the end, Linda was the one who volunteered. ... She had recovered a little from her brother's death, trying to act normal with everyone, but there was an odd feeling around her whenever they would converse. ... When she volunteered it came as a surprise, and they thought it might be best to give her a task like so, to get her mind off it. ... When going through the Parasite's belongings, they found that Mantis had written his own personal Poison ability book. ... It was given to Paul to look over and he had found that it had cultivation techniques that would teach someone to get their ability up to level eight. ... It was the thing he needed most right now. ... It was a tough time for the Cursed faction, but Paul reminded them that many more tough times were probably to come in the future, even though big things were happening they couldn't just take a break. ... They needed to proceed with their plan. ... The plan that would place them in prime position to become part of the big three. ... A powerhouse of the human race. ... In those two days, wiping the sweat from his head, Alex looked at the last piece of equipment on his table.'Finally the emperor tier equipment.. ... is done.'****For MVS artwork and updates follow on Instagram and Facebook: jksmanga\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 264] Preparing: Chapter 963: A. ... d. ... u. ... l. ... ts are liars! ... Although Quinn was a little worried about Shiro, he seemed to be doing better after their small talk. ... He tried out a few of the weapons as intended but it still didn't seem like he found something that he was used to yet. ... It was either that, or Shiro was still holding out to learn the Graylash ability.'Shiro, if you dived in when you saw your classmates were in trouble, you're going to do the same thing again. ... As sad as this is, without any strength or an ability it might be impossible to help them.' Quinn thought. ... 'Maybe there is something I can teach him which makes it so he doesn't have to learn an ability.''Quinn are you thinking of teaching the kid Qi, you know what will happen if you do that right?' Vincent questioned him.'I know, the military are already interested in it, since Pure mentioned it, but I was debating whether it was something I should attempt to teach others anyway. ... Leo seems to also have a more open mind about it, and he's started to teach those on the Cursed ship while continuing his search.' Quinn replied. ... If Quinn was going to open up Qi to the whole world, then he at least wanted those in his group to have a bit of a head start, besides Qi was a strong skill to use against the vampires, and with Quinn being closely related to these types of beings, he thought it might be best for the Cursed faction to learn something that could potentially be used against them. ... It reminded Quinn though, that it shouldn't have to be this way, people shouldn't have to get stronger or better at fighting just for a better life. ... In a way, he was doing that all himself so others didn't have to. ... The class was finally coming to an end, and Quinn said his goodbyes to them. ... Everyone was pretty drained, and there looked to be a couple of students who already knew how to activate the beast weapon to use it to its full potential. ... None from his class though. ... Quinn wondered if all the students that had been placed in the Cursed house might have been all low ranking ones. ... However, it didn't seem to be the case for the other classes, as those from the other classes were quite balanced based on what he was seeing. ... It was only his class that was full of low levels.'It still doesn't help me know if it is just a coincidence or not.'Everyone had left the room quite quickly, it had been a tiring day after all, and while in the room on his own, Quinn thought he would take this time to perhaps figure out a few things. ... Thinking about Qi, he was trying to figure out the third stage of Qi. ... The reason for this was because it might be Paul's answer to finding a cure as well. ... Qi, the human life energy, and the vampire energy didn't mix well, but Quinn had figured out a way for it to power his attacks. ... From what he had seen Chris do, the third stage of Qi, was taking the Qi from inside your body and using it outside. ... With this concept, he thought that maybe if he learnt how to do this with Qi, he could do it with the vampire energy as well. ... Similar to how he was able to turn into a Bloodsucker by filling his Qi ball with red energy, maybe there was a way to extinguish all the red energy from one's body.'It's a long shot what you're thinking Quinn.' Vincent thought. ... 'I don't know much about Qi, but here is one thing, Qi only slows down the vampire's healing process, it doesn't stop it. ... Even when using your second stage it stops until the foreign Qi energy has vanished, or been removed. ... The main thing is your body is now different, so there are living cells in your body constantly producing this vampire energy. ... Yes you might be able to get rid of it temporarily, but eventually it will come back. ... \"Although Vincent was a much smarter man than Quinn was, at the same time, even he admitted he didn't understand everything about Qi, so Quinn thought he would give it a shot. ... Besides, even if it didn't work it was another weapon he had in his arsenal. ... Meanwhile, both Venus and Swin were happily walking back from their class together. ... They had stayed a little bit behind because they wanted to ask their teacher a few more questions, but it looked like he had a lot on his mind so they decided to leave it for another day for now. ... Still, they were excited and couldn't stop talking about all the weapons they had both tried. ... \"I liked the spear the best, it really felt like I had a really long arm. ... \" Venus said, as he thrusted forward, imagining a spear in his hand. ... \"I wanted to try on some armour as well, but I guess that will be another class. ... \" Swin said. ... \"Maybe we can help you practice. ... \" A voice from behind was heard, and soon they felt their heads being pulled under one's arm by a few people, and being dragged along to a different location. ... \"Erlen, your, your, you're here. ... \" Venus stuttered. ... \"'Your, your, your', shut the hell up Venus! ... \" Erlen said as he chucked Venus from under his arm, across the floor. ... Soon after, Swin was chucked on the floor by his side as well. ... As the two boys looked around, they could see that they had been dragged between two large buildings, between the beast weapons class, and the dormitory. ... There was a pathway with a glass roof over them that allowed them to see the orange sky created from the sunset, while they walked to their dorms. ... With it being the end of the day, there weren't many students left that would walk this way, and there were only the students from the beast weapons class that would come this way to head to their dorms, which meant, it was unlikely they would be seen. ... Looking up, Erlen's face had a creepy smile. ... He had black rough spiked hair, and the five behind him were his usual followers he always had throughout school. ... \"You of all people Venus, I never expected that you would tell the teacher about what happened. ... Doesn't your dad work for my company? ... That's right, a poor worker who didn't have a great ability, but worked hard to eventually give his son a level two telekinesis ability. ... \"\"We didn't say anything! ... \" Swin objected. ... \"Hey, shut up! ... Even if your parents don't work for my company, we have connections with those above. ... I can find out where your family works too and make life hell for them. ... \" Erlen stated. ... That immediately got Swin to shut up. ... He didn't mind taking beatings himself, but if it was his family. ... He didn't want them to get hurt or their life to be any worse. ... \"Even if you didn't tell the teacher, then you should have told him that it was a lie. ... Told him that what they said wasn't true or it was an accident. ... Now we are just going to have to make it so you never tell the others again. ... I believe I only punched one of your eyes last time, let's make that two this time. ... \"Erlen said, as he made a fist and started to swing it towards Swin's face, but mid-swing a loud scream could be heard coming from the side. ... \"Arghhh! ... \" A male student could be seen running towards them and a few seconds later, Erlen could feel a sharp pain in his side. ... \"Shiro! ... \" Venus called out, but Shiro was too shocked to hear anything. ... Usually one screaming before attacking their enemy would be a stupid thing, but Shiro had to scream, it was the only way he could go through with what he was doing. ... As he took a step back, a small amount of blood had gotten on his hands, and a dagger was stuck inside of Erlen.'Did he steal that from the beast weapons class?' Venus thought. ... \"You, you really stabbed me, who the heck are you! ... \" Erlen said, as he pulled the dagger out and threw it right back at Shiro, stabbing him in the shoulder. ... Soon the other boys had pinned him down. ... Placing his hand on the wound, the area around Erlen's wound started to freeze over. ... \"This wound will heal. ... \" Erlen said, walking over. ... \"But what I'm about to do to you; your whole life, and your family, that will never heal. ... You think you're some hero? ... Now I remember you from last time as well. ... \"Shiro was struggling, trying to break free. ... Being powerless and knowing his classmates would be in trouble again. ... Shiro felt like he had to do something, but in his head even when he was stabbing Erlen he never knew what he was going to do after this.'Maybe I deserve this after all, what the hell was I thinking. ... It was that stupid teacher's fault. ... Didn't he say he would help? ... That he would be there for us? ... Well, where the hell is he now?! ... Teachers, adults, they're all liars! ... I had to act myself!' Shiro screamed internally as he saw a frozen hand move towards him. ... Once again, a projectile was seen having been thrown towards Erlen's hand and had hit it away. ... \"Those people, Quinn likes those people, so I can't let you hurt them. ... \" A voice said. ... Turning around, annoyed at how many people were getting involved, Erlen went to look at this brave student, but it was one he didn't really recognise. ... It was a light brown haired boy, and standing next to him, was a plain guy that seemed almost invisible.*******\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 271] Preparing: Chapter 970: What is the strongest ability? ... The crowd of students who had attended the elemental class for the special demonstration, never imagined that they would have witnessed an actual skill being used, and against another student at that. ... However, what was quite surprising, was while Chucky had only gotten second hand aftershock from touching Sil, he was down on one knee. ... As for Sil, he had remained standing.'Doesn't hurt my arse!' Chucky thought. ... 'I feel like my whole insides have been fried.' His immediate reaction after receiving an attack like this one, was to pay back the person that had dealt it. ... Maybe there were some that would be frightened, but Chucky's natural response was to fight. ... However, he knew who Robin Graylash was. ... One of the strongest members of the Graylash family, who's name had spread quite far and wide. ... If he was to do anything, it would be pointless. ... Which was why, based on his own feelings, he couldn't imagine what Sil was feeling or would do. ... He was a person who was a little unstable. ... Looking at Sil, it seemed like the worst was coming true, as Sil raised his hand towards Robin, with an open palm and looked at him. ... The students weren't stupid. ... If anyone did this it only meant one thing, Sil was planning an attack.'He can't be thinking of attacking a head general?' Shiro thought, watching from the side. ... Although, he didn't know Sil. ... Sil had saved him that day, and he had seen some of his strength. ... However, he couldn't imagine Sil beating a head general, and one of the strongest members of the Graylash family who had the strongest ability in existence. ... Chucky, who was by Sil's side, was having the same thoughts as well. ... He tried to get up, but his legs didn't seem to listen. ... When trying to move his leg, it was as if the muscles in his arm would activate instead.'Is this the general's skill, then how is Sil able to move?' Chucky thought. ... The truth was, it was the same for Sil, but with years of training different types of ability, he had quickly worked out which muscles had switched to which parts. ... If moving his leg moved his right arm in a certain way, then he would just do that. ... \"Sil, think of Quinn, we can't cause a scene. ... \" Chucky desperately said, thinking it was the only words that would calm him down. ... For some reason, there was one person that Sil always responded to, which was why he thought this might work, and a few seconds later, Sil was seen placing his hand down. ... Through the whole ordeal, Robin had a smile on his face. ... He wasn't frightened when the student raised his hand. ... \"Good, now if you want to stay I hope there won't be any more distractions,\" Robin said and continued on with his show. ... Chucky decided to move him and Sil to the back to check if he was okay. ... His body could now work as it seemed like the effect of the lightning was only a temporary effect. ... The students were now also staying clear of them, afraid Robin might just lash out at them again. ... Which meant that Sil could no longer touch the other students.'Maybe we will get another chance, another way.' Chunky thought. ... Surprisingly, there was one person from the crowd that did approach them, and that was Shiro. ... \"Is he okay? ... \" Shiro asked. ... \"I'm fine, like he said it didn't hurt, but it was annoying. ... \" Sil replied, folding his arms. ... Even if it didn't hurt he was clearly frustrated. ... The speech continued from Robin and his demonstration was about to finish, so he decided to end the show off with a Big Bang, and started to show many different spectacles and skills, moving himself at the speed of lightning, creating thunderbolts to hit certain cards that he threw in the air. ... It was more similar to a magic show but it had done its job and the students were impressed including Shiro.'I see, now I understand why the Head General agreed to do a demonstration even though this is the Cursed house elemental class.' Chucky thought. ... 'He wants to win over the students so when they choose to select a group to join, they will chose the Graylash family. ... Smart move.'The demonstration was finally complete and Robin had a few last words. ... \"Now remember, although I said imagination is the most important thing, there will be things that I have shown that are just not possible without the Graylash family ability. ... After all, that is why our ability is the strongest ability in the world. ... \"The students were ready to give a round of applause until they were interrupted once again. ... \"That's not the strongest ability in the world. ... \" A voice shouted. ... When they turned around to see who spoke, they saw that it was none other than the student who had been attacked. ... \"Oh, I see it was the boy who had interrupted me before. ... Well, if you think it isn't true then do you mind giving me an example? ... \" Robin asked. ... At this point, Chucky didn't know what to do, but at least he thought a fight wouldn't break out this way, or he hoped. ... Hearing these words, Shiro who was next to them was reminded of something general Hardy had said to him, about how there were other strong abilities out there as well. ... \"Of course. ... \" Sil replied. ... \"The earth ability is well known to be a weakness of the lightning ability. ... If an earth user and a lightning user were of the same strength, most of the time the earth user would win. ... \"The students also knew about this as well. ... They had seen this happen at the inter-base tournament last year. ... At the finals it was an Earth user against one of the strongest Graylash students and the earth ability user had one. ... They turned their heads waiting for an answer from the teacher. ... \"I'll give you half a point for that answer. ... Although what you say is correct, when it comes to cultivating the Graylash family is more advanced and has many skills. ... To put it simply, for every great earth user out here, there are about ten Graylash family members that could match them in strength. ... On top of that, the cap for the earth ability is far lower than what one can do with the lightning ability, no earth user, even the Supreme commander Oscar has been able to match up to our Leader Owen. ... \" Robin replied. ... \"This is why I say lightning is the strongest ability there is. ... \"The students then turned their heads, as they waited for Sil to reply next. ... \"There are still other abilities that are stronger, what about the Shadow ability? ... \" Sil asked. ... Hearing these words, the students started to gossip. ... Currently in the world the humans only know of one person with the shadow ability, and that was the Cursed leader, Quinn Talen. ... The students started to debate, but the problem was, no one knew the full power of the shadow ability. ... They turned their heads once more expecting a comeback from Robin. ... But instead he just started clapping. ... \"Bravo, although I will not admit that the lightning ability is weaker than the shadow, I can not also say that it is stronger because I simply know nothing about it. ... It is a case that can't be proven. ... \" Robin repliedThe students were quite surprised by the answer Robin gave, he thought he would have been smug or big headed but he gave an honest answer and because of that, they respected him. ... \"Enough arguments, let's get this lesson started. ... \" Robin said. ... The students spread out, and started to practice their abilities, while the teachers and assistants would go around giving pointers. ... Some students were even able to do a light spar with each other, as there was a doctor on standby in the class in case anything happened. ... During this, Sil wanted to attempt to ask some of the students for a light spar so he could use their ability, however, as soon as he moved a certain someone had approached them, and it was none other than Robin. ... When he approached Sil, he held out his hand as if waiting for a handshake. ... \"I would like to apologise to you, I had hit you with my skill out of anger but I should have known to hold back. ... You are only students, of course you will talk and misbehave. ... This is why I'm not suited to be a teacher. ... \" Robin nervously chuckled to himself.'Hey what about me? ... Is he not going to apologise to me?' Chucky thought. ... 'Well, at least this guy seems to be quite nice. ... I guess not all generals are bad people.'Taking his hand, Sil decided to give it a shake. ... \"On top of this, I would like to give you a little personal lesson. ... \" Using his fingers to blow a whistle, in an instant a student appeared by the side of him. ... \"This is one of my best pupils, Lin. ... He studied at the Graylash household before we sent him here to the military base. ... To be honest looking over him is one of the reasons why I decided to join and become a head general here. ... It was impressive how you didn't fall from my strike earlier, I think you have some skill. ... Why don't you two have a little sparring match and then after I can give you some pointers. ... What do you say? ... \" Robin asked. ... Chucky was about to say no for him. ... But was interrupted before he could. ... Sil had already said. ... \"Okay. ... \"Still not having left their side, Shiro was amazed that the head general and one of the top members in the Graylash family was willing to give pointers to Sil. ... Because of this, he decided to stay close, with hopes to somehow prove himself to the Graylash family. ... Both Sil and Lin were about to get ready in position, but before he did, Sil turned around and looked at Robin. ... \"I didn't finish answering your question before. ... I said that there were abilities stronger than the Graylash family, and one of them is mine. ... \"******\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 272] Preparing: Chapter 971: Who taught who? ... Just when Chucky was beginning to think that perhaps the centre of attention would no longer be on them, Sil went ahead and said those words. ... A few students around had heard what was spoken as they were already looking in their direction. ... After all, it wasn't everyday a famous head general would attend class like they had done. ... After seeing who was brought over and the words of a sparring match, nearly everyone around had practically stopped focusing on their own skills.'Quinn, I thought you were giving me an easy job when I first met you, but this task is a lot harder than I initially thought. ... Now I know why you wanted me to keep an eye on him.' Chucky thought, but looking at Sil walking away and getting ready for his fight, he couldn't be mad at him. ... 'Well, that was a cool line you said at the end so I'll forgive you, now let's just beat this student and get on with the task.'While Robin was making sure the area was clear and stood towards the centre of where the two were fighting, another visitor had joined the room. ... Walking in, wanting to have a look at how the class was going, was the head general of one of the Earthborn, Samantha. ... She too had heard that one of the Graylash generals was having a demonstration today. ... Unfortunately due to her own duties in her own group, she couldn't appear at the start of the class, but still decided that it would be best if she popped down to see a first hand demonstration of a peak Graylash family member. ... It was at that moment that she spotted him with two boys as if he was about to referee a match.'Wait a minute, isn't that the boy that Innu brought into the meeting?' Samantha recognised, but didn't think much of it, and decided to stay by the sidelines and watch the sparring match play out. ... Robin looked to his right, where Sil was. ... \"Ready? ... \" He asked and then looked to his left, where his personal student Lin was as well. ... \"Ready? ... \"'Alright, so you say your ability is stronger than that of the Graylash family, let's see if you're all talk.' Ropbin thought, as he swung his arms down to signal it was the start of the fight. ... In an instant, both of Lin's hands were covered in lightning, and placing them together the first thing did was fire them off like a lightning bolt right towards Sil.'The activation speed of his ability is amazing for a kid at such a young age, the Graylash family seem to have gotten stronger since their new leader.' Samantha thought. ... 'I heard their leader had passed down some of his personal techniques. ... It seems they have been put to good use.'Seeing how Sil had gotten hit by something similar last time, most of the students saw no hope for him. ... Even Chucky was a little worried. ... Lifting his hands up, Sil was calm as ever as he brought up a wall of earth from the ground. ... When the lightning strike had hit, it smashed the top layer crumbling it to pieces.'My lightning strike won't be stopped by just any mere wall.' Lin thought, until he saw the impact it had made. ... His strike had only managed to crumble off an inch deep off the wall. ... 'How high is this person's earth level?'\"Wait an earth ability?! ... \" Shiro was so shocked, he blurted out the question. ... He truly didn't have a clue what was going on. ... The last time he saw Sil fight he had used telekinesis, so how was he able to use the earth ability? ... Soon though, the wall started to move like a wave, and it wasn't the only one. ... The whole ground had formed into giant waves of earth. ... Lin tried his best to fire stronger lighting attacks, but when it hit the giant waves of earth it looked like it would do nothing. ... Seeing this, he tried to use his speed to outrun the wave. ... Turning right, there was another wave taller than himself coming his way, and it was the same on the left.'How much earth can he control?' Lin started to think. ... Seeing all this there was only one thing he could do, and running straight towards it he covered his whole body in lightning. ... Jumping off, he spun his body around, spinning forward making his whole body into a large lighting bolt. ... \"One of the signature moves of the Graylash family, although I haven't experienced it myself I have seen it in action a few times. ... \" Samantha thought. ... 'Still, that boy, how can he control so much earth?'What everyone else around failed to realise, although what Sil was doing didn't look too impressive, controlling this amount of earth at once would require a huge amount of MC points. ... Points beyond that of a level eight user. ... \"He won't break through. ... \" Robin mumbled. ... When Lin hit the wall, although the damage created to the earth this time was stronger than his previous attack, it was useless when there were multiple waves of mud forming in mere seconds, and soon, it had collapsed on him entirely. ... \"Stop, the fight is over! ... \" Robin shouted. ... \"Get rid of all this earth. ... \"Sil listened and soon, all the waves of the earth were returned to where it once came from, and Lin could be seen covered in dirt. ... \"I believe you already know I went easy on him. ... \" Sil mentioned. ... Robin first made sure his student was okay, and he was completely fine. ... He knew what Sil had said was true. ... All he did was move large amounts of earth, he didn't really attack with it, but just overwhelmed him showing the extent of his powers. ... \"Don't worry about losing Lin, you just have to use this loss to get stronger, and I wouldn't be upset. ... It looks like you lost against a monster. ... \" Robin said. ... After seeing to Lin, Robin walked forward one more time and he only had one thing on his mind. ... \"I said I would teach you a lesson, but it looks like you taught my student a lesson instead, so why don't we continue the lesson. ... Are you okay with giving me a go? ... \" Robin asked. ... The students who were pretending to still be focusing on the class, had now completely stopped, and the teacher and assistants that were giving them a telling off had stopped as well. ... They just couldn't believe what they had heard and now this was something they wanted to see. ... \"After all, I need to prove to you that the Graylash ability is the strongest. ... \" Said Robin. ... At this point, Chucky thought that Sil was just going to do what he wanted anyway, and after seeing what Sil had produced with the mud, and the other members of the Cursed family, he was wondering if the members of the Cursed knew just how strong the members in their family were.'I was lucky to join this team.'\"Okay. ... \" Sil replied calmly, and got back to the starting position he was in before. ... It was safe to say that, no longer was anyone paying attention to the lesson and instead was just watching the fight that was about to appear before their very eyes.'That boy, he is incredibly strong,' Samantha thought, and she immediately decided to make a call to a certain high ranking individual. ... Soon on the other end, Oscar the Supreme Commander had answered. ... \"I'm sorry to bother you at such an important time, but I have just spotted a student that has an incredible talent, we must make sure he comes to the Earthborn group no matter what! ... \" Samantha claimed. ... \"Oh, do you know the boy's name and class? ... \" Oscar asked. ... Thinking of the details she had gotten from Innu, she remembered the name. ... \"The boy goes by the name Sil. ... \" She replied. ... There was a slight pause from Oscar until he eventually replied with a big sigh. ... \"That boy, I know he is talented, unfortunately he already belongs to the Cursed. ... \"At that moment, the fight in which Lin was now signalling the match to start, had begun. ... As soon as he threw his hands down, Sil was this time the aggressor starting with the waves of mud the same as before. ... As they came towards him though, from all directions, everyone was wondering just what was going to happen. ... At first, Robin attacked a wave of earth, but as soon as it crumbled it was quickly rebuilt. ... Seeing this, even Lin was beginning to worry, thinking his teacher didn't have an answer.'Destroying that wall will just be a waste of my time.' Robin thought. ... Before the wall could reach him from all ends, his whole body started to illuminate in a blue glow, and soon all four waves from each direction completely consumed the spot he was standing in. ... As they fell to the ground though, there was no figure or person that could be seen, and when they looked up, Robin was already standing off to his side. ... \"Your earth powers are strong so I can see why you're confident. ... But the Graylash family also has speed. ... \" Robin claimed, as he fired off a lightning bolt directly towards Sil. ... However, what happened next, no one had expected. ... Sil's body too started to light up blue, and it looked as if his whole body had vanished and the lightning bolt had hit nothing but thin air. ... When looking around the arena, Sil was seen in a different place, and now the entirety of his right hand was covered in lightning. ... \"Now he has lightning abilities as well, who is this person? ... \" Shiro kept thinking. ... All the students were discussing seeing him use multiple abilities trying to figure out who he was. ... As for Robin, after seeing this, his eyes widened and the lightning covering his arms immediately faded. ... \"I'm sorry, I apologize for everything I have done. ... \" Robin said. ... \"If I knew who you were I would have treated you with a lot more respect. ... \" Robin then bowed down to Sil once again. ... \"I hope the Cursed faction leader is doing well. ... The Graylash family owe you and him a great debt. ... \"After that, Robin was seen leaving the entire place, and had completely left the training hall they were in, leaving everyone in a stunned confusion. ... Samantha looked at Sil trying to figure out who he was but she had no clue. ... \"This student belongs to the Cursed faction, and the Graylash general just paid him so much respect like that. ... Why do we keep hearing about the Cursed faction members? ... The Graylash faction should be in higher positions and more respected than these strangers. ... Yet the Cursed faction keep being treated with this level of respect. ... \"Just what is the Cursed faction? ... \" Samantha thought. ... At the same time, Shiro too was starting to become more and more fascinated with the Cursed faction as well.'The Cursed faction is a lot stronger than you think.' Shiro remembered his teacher saying these words.******\n",

      "üîä [Chapter 282] Preparing: Chapter 981: A waste of time! ... Standing by the side, Kazz knew straight away that Quinn had done something. ... As the last time he had fought with Cindy he had done the exact same thing. ... When Quinn's soul weapon was active, a faint purple glow would appear around all of the shadows Quinn used. ... One of the main benefits of using the soul weapon 'Shadow Overload' was the fact that Quinn could now use the shadow as he wished without the need to worry if it would run out or not. ... However, this wasn't the reason Quinn had decided to use it now. ... The Boneclaw's teleportation speed was far faster than before. ... But there were more than just one benefit of using the soul weapon. ... Quinn's soul weapon would also improve his casting speed with the shadow when using skills, and the general movement of his shadows.'Not that I'm going to need it, Quinn thought as he held out both of his hands, and started to create a dome of shadow over the Boneclaw. ... The Boneclaw would teleport out of it the same as he did last time, but seeing where it was now, Quinn would quickly summon another dome over it again, in an instant before it could react.'It looks like my guess was correct.' Although the Boneclaw was able to teleport out of the shadow dome, it wasn't able to attack at the same time and it didn't seem to know exactly where it was teleporting to. ... It seemed like it would take a few seconds before it repositioned itself and noticed where Quinn was. ... While in the dome, the Boneclaw was unable to see, so it couldn't focus where to place its black teleporters. ... The only thing it could do was look in a certain direction in the dome, and cast a portal to the other side to escape, and soon, when it was busy coming out of one of the shadows, Quinn was appearing directly behind it through his own shadow with a large hammer strike of his own. ... However, the Boneclaw was fast, as it managed to create a large portal the same size as Quinn in front of him, and sinking through it, Quinn was redirected to another place, causing his hammer strike to strike one of the buildings in the inner castle area nearby. ... A loud bang was heard as his fist went through a building wall, and a couple of the ones behind it crumbled to the floor. ... Still, Quinn wasn't worried. ... Compared to last time, he had more MC points to play with. ... What he didn't realise was although Shadow Overload allowed him to use the shadow as much as he wished, he could still only control only slightly more than his MC points allowed at one time. ... With his MC points above a thousand, Quinn was able to control a larger amount of shadow. ... Having created several domes, he was still able to protect himself using the shadow. ... \"So you seem to be quite the quick thinker, but I have a lot of tricks up my sleeve!' Quinn shouted as he fired out a blood bullet into one of his shadows in front of him, and it appeared behind the Boneclaw, going through its forearm. ... This was a skill that was too quick for the Boneclaw to react to, and when it turned around, it could see several circle shadows floating in the entire area. ... Quinn had spread them around, hovering as if they were land mines all over the field. ... \"I think I've got the hang of how far you can teleport at once. ... Try teleporting somewhere, and you'll run into any of these,\" Quinn said, as he activated a disk with a razor edge, covered in the shadow.'If I throw it into any of these shadows, I can redirect it to try to follow the Boneclaw, and I can also throw blood swipes and even escape through them as well.'In a way, Quinn was using the shadows as a better version of the teleporting skill that the Boneclaw could use. ... Quinn was able to go through one shadow, and appear out of any of the shadows hovering about at any time. ... Quinn was ready to throw the Shadow disk into one of the shadow portals, but stopped himself just seconds before, as he saw the Boneclaw turning into a black mist, and it was soon heading towards Quinn. ... \"Did I win the fight? ... \" Quinn wondered.'I don't think you won.' Vincent replied. ... 'I just think the Boneclaw has accepted you again, for now.'Hearing this, Quinn didn't like it one bit. ... Was Vincent saying that he might choose to challenge him again in the future? ... He already had a headache with Arthur and now had to worry about the Boneclaw as well. ... It was also safe to say that Quinn was beyond annoyed. ... He had used the Shadow Overload skill, and now he also had to face the backlash of using it. ... He didn't even get to use it fully or for a long time. ... It was as if the Boneclaw said, show me everything you had, and then decided to just go away when Quinn did.[Yout total MC points are now '1150 points']The amount of points lost wasn't a deal-breaker, but it wasn't like Quinn could easily obtain points through using the skill Shadow Eater either. ... Technically at the moment each time he would use this skill his MC points would lower, so it was best not to use it for now. ... The other problem was right after using the soul weapon, all of his MC points would go down to 0. ... Even though he didn't use much of the shadow in this fight compared to with Cindy. ... He would now have to wait for a period of time for them to restore. ... If he had used a skill like this against a demon tier beast and then ran into Hilston, he would have been a sitting duck not being able to use his shadow ability.'Just a word of advice to you as a past leader.' Vincent said. ... 'Although I wasn't the best when it came to hand to hand combat, and you are currently better than me when I was your age, for a vampire your skills are quite poor. ... You only know the basics, something taught to the regular vampires, but you are a leader. ... \"Since you use gauntlets as your weapons, it would be best for you to try and further develop your fighting skills. ... So far, you have done well, relying on powers such as Qi, and mixing it with your vampire powers, and also the shadow, but what if you are unable to use both of those things? ... Just like with the Boneclaw in the future, there may be an opponent that will need these set of skills. ... \"Honestly, Quinn couldn't agree more, but it wasn't like he knew any grand martial artist. ... Leo was the closest person to one, but he was a master swordsman.'I wonder if there's something I can do?''The second point.' Vincent continued, although we have already discussed this, it's about your blood abilities. ... It's all well improving your blood control, but just like with the shadow, you need to learn more advanced blood skills. ... They are currently quite simple. ... \"'Couldn't you teach me, since you used to be a great leader and all.' Quinn said.'I guess I could give it a go, but through words alone, it would be hard. ... It would be best for you to see the skills yourself. ... Maybe you should get friendly with one of the leaders at some point.' Vincent half jokingly said. ... Still, Quinn didn't think Vincent was giving him enough credit. ... Quinn didn't show the Boneclaw everything he had, and there were even the new shadow skills he had yet to test. ... Seeing the Boneclaw disappear like so, Kazz was relieved, but witnessing Quinn use his special power again, she truly did feel like she was looking at one of the strongest vampire leaders. ... Even if he was lacking in certain areas, no one could deny how strong he was. ... \"Well, let's forget about that little thing, shall we? ... \" Quinn said, looking back at Kazz. ... \"Let's get back. ... \"The incident with Quinn's familiar wasn't something that needed to be urgently reported, since it was his own familiar and didn't involve others. ... No one had even seen the fight, but Kazz still reported the matter to Bryce. ... After all, she was loyal to him as he was her father and even more so her king. ... Although, Bryce didn't think much of this, and was far more interested in the reports she had made earlier. ... \"You may leave now Kazz, you did a good job. ... Thank you. ... \" Bryce said, sitting down on the king's throne. ... When Kazz left the room, out from the side as if he was almost invisible, Tempus stood. ... \"You heard about the wall, right? ... \" Bryce asked. ... \"Do you think you will be able to restore it to its former self? ... \"\"Perhaps, we might not get the whole thing, but we should learn something, but I'm wondering what you plan to do with such a wall? ... \" Tempus asked. ... \"I hate the shadow, but everyone has to admit their power, but the reason why so many people disliked the shadow in the past was because it belonged to the Punishers, a force equal to that of the king. ... This is something that should have never happened. ... It's time the king had its set of own shadow users. ... \" Bryce smiled. ... \"I bet Arthur will be pleasantly surprised to see them when he returns. ... \"\"And how do you expect to get past the doors without informing Muka? ... \" Tempus asked. ... \"Oh don't worry about that, I have more power than you think. ... Actually you might already know. ... Otherwise I doubt you would be standing by my side. ... \"******\n",
